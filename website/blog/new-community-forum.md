# New community forum

Hello Wazo Platform community!

As you might have known, 2 months ago the old Wazo Community forum (`https://projects.wazo.community/`) lost 2 years of data due to a bad upgrade and failing backups. Plus, it's been plagued by spamming bots which forced us to allow subscription on approval only... that we can't deal with since dozens of bots try to subscribe every day! Hence we chose to switch it to read-only for archiving purpose, and switch to a brand new one, modern and hosted.

Here is the new forum : [https://wazo-platform.discourse.group/](https://wazo-platform.discourse.group/).

And if a forum doesn't fit you, feel free to come talk with the community on our Mattermost [https://mm.wazo.community/wazo-platform](https://mm.wazo.community/wazo-platform).
