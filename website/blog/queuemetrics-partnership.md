We are proud to announce our successful integration with Loway's QueueMetrics-Live call-center suite.

Loway's QueueMetrics-Live call-center suite, is now fully integrated with Wazo IPBX.

Wazo is a unified communication platform and a full-featured IPBX based on Asterisk technology, oriented towards enterprise communications.
