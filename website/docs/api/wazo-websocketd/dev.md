## Getting Started

To use the service, you need to:

1.  connect to it on port 443 through `/api/websocketd` endpoint using an
    encrypted WebSocket connection.
2.  authenticate to it by providing a wazo-auth token that has the `websocketd` ACL. If you don't
    know how to obtain a wazo-auth token from your Wazo, consult the
    [documentation on wazo-auth](/uc-doc/system/wazo-auth).

For example, if you want to use the service located at `example.org` with the token `some-token-id`,
you would use the URL `wss://example.org/api/websocketd/?token=some-token-id&version=2`.

The [SSL/TLS certificate](/uc-doc/system/https_certificate) that is used by
the WebSocket server is the same as the one used by the Wazo web interface and the REST APIs. By
default, this is a self-signed certificate, and web browsers will prevent connections from being
successfully established for security reasons. On most web browsers, this can be circumvented by
first visiting the `https://<wazo-ip>/api/websocketd/` URL and adding a security exception. Other solutions to
this problem are described in the
[connection section](/uc-doc/system/https_certificate).

After a successful connection and authentication to the service, the server will send the following
message:

```json
{ "op": "init", "code": 0, "data": { "version": 2 } }
```

This indicates that the server is ready to accept more commands from the client. Had an error
happened, the server would have closed the connection, possibly with one of the
[service specific WebSocket close code](/uc-doc/api_sdk/websocket#ws-status-code).

The message you see is part of the small
[JSON-based protocol](/uc-doc/api_sdk/websocket#ws-protocol) that is used
for the client/server interaction.

To receive events on your WebSocket connection, you need to tell the server which type of events you
are interested in, and then tell it to start sending you these events. For example, if you are
interested in the
["endpoint_status_update" events](/uc-doc/api_sdk/message_bus#endpoint-status-update),
you send the following command:

```json
{ "op": "subscribe", "data": { "event_name": "endpoint_status_update" } }
```

If all goes well, the server will respond with:

```json
{ "op": "subscribe", "code": 0 }
```

Once you have subscribed to all the events you are interested in, you ask the server to start
sending you the matching events by sending the following command:

```json
{ "op": "start" }
```

The server will respond with:

```json
{ "op": "start", "code": 0 }
```

Once you have received this message, all the other messages you'll receive will be messages
originating from the bus, in the same format as they were on the bus.

### Example

Here's a rudimentary example of a web page accessing the service:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Wazo WebSocket Example</title>
    <script>
      let socket = null;
      let started = false;

      function connect() {
        if (socket != null) {
          console.log('socket already connected');
          return;
        }

        const host = document.getElementById('host').value;
        const token_id = document.getElementById('token').value;
        socket = new WebSocket('wss://' + host + '/api/websocketd/?token=' + token_id);
        socket.onclose = function (event) {
          socket = null;
          console.log(
            'websocketd closed with code ' + event.code + " and reason '" + event.reason + "'"
          );
        };
        socket.onmessage = function (event) {
          const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
          switch (msg.op) {
            case 'init':
              subscribe('*');
              start();
              break;
            case 'start':
              console.log('waiting for messages');
              break;
            case 'event':
              console.log('message received: ' + msg.data);
              break;
          }
        };
        started = false;
      }

      function subscribe(event_name) {
        const msg = {
          op: 'subscribe',
          data: {
            event_name: event_name,
          },
        };
        socket.send(JSON.stringify(msg));
      }

      function start() {
        const msg = {
          op: 'start',
        };
        socket.send(JSON.stringify(msg));
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Open the web console to see what's happening.</p>
    <form>
      <div>
        <label for="host">Host:</label>
        <input type="text" id="host" autofocus />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="token">Token ID:</label>
        <input type="text" id="token" size="35" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <button type="button" onclick="connect();">Connect</button>
      </div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

The page has a form for the user to enter a host and token ID, and has a connect button. When the
button is clicked, the `connect` function is called, and the WebSocket connection is created at line
18 (using the [WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)):

```js
socket = new WebSocket('wss://' + host + '/api/websocketd/?version=2&token=' + token_id);
```

Then, at line 23, a `onmessage` callback is set on the WebSocket object:

```js
socket.onmessage = function (event) {
  const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
  switch (msg.op) {
    case 'init':
      subscribe('endpoint_status_update');
      subscribe('user_status_update');
      start();
      break;
    case 'start':
      console.log('waiting for messages');
      break;
    case 'event':
      console.log('message received: ' + msg.data);
      break;
  }
};
```

After a successful connection to the service, an "init" message will be received by the client. When
the client receives this message, it sends two subscribe commands (e.g.
`subscribe("endpoint_status_update")`) and a start command (e.g. `start()`). When the client
receives the "start" message, it sets the `started` flag. After that, all the other messages it
receives will be logged to the console.

## Reference

The WebSocket service is provided by `wazo-websocketd`, and its behaviour can be configured via its
[configuration files](/uc-doc/system/configuration_files) located under the
<span data-role="file">/etc/wazo-websocketd</span> directory. After modifying the configuration
files, you need to restart `wazo-websocketd` with `systemctl restart wazo-websocketd`.

### Connection

The service is available on port 443 using `/api/websocketd` endpoint

The canonical URL to reach the service is `wss://<host>/api/websocketd/`.

The connection is always encrypted. The certificate and private key used by the server can be
changed in the configuration file. By default, since the certificate is self-signed, you'll have to
either:

- add a security exception on the client machines that access the service
- use a certificate signed by an untrusted CA and add the CA bundle on the system that access the
  service
- use a trusted certificate

See the [Certificates for HTTPS](/uc-doc/system/https_certificate) section
for more information on certificate configuration.

### Authentication

Authentication is done by passing a wazo-auth token ID in the `token` query parameter.
Authentication is mandatory.

The token must have the `websocketd` ACL.

When the token expires, the server close the connection with the status code 4003. There is
currently no way to change the token of an existing connection. A new connection must be made when
the token expires.

### Events Access Control

Clients connected to `wazo-websocketd` only receive events that they are authorized to receive. For
example, a client connected with a token obtained from the `wazo_user` authentication backend will
_not_ receive call events of other users.

When a message is received from the bus by `wazo-websocketd`, it extracts the ACL from the
`required_acl` key of the event. If the field is missing, no clients will receive the event. If the
value is null, all subscribed clients will receive the event. If the value is a string, then all
subscribed clients which have a matching ACL will receive the event.

No authorization check is done at subscription time. Checks are only done when an event is received
by the server. This mean a client can subscribe to an event "foo", but will never receive any of
these events if it does not have the matching ACL.

See the [Events](/uc-doc/api_sdk/message_bus#bus-events) section for more
information on the required ACL of events which are available by default on Wazo.

### Status Code

The WebSocket connection might be closed by the server using one of following status code:

- 4001: No token ID was provided.
- 4002: Authentication failed. Either the token ID is invalid, expired, or does not have the
  necessary ACL.
- 4003: Authentication expired. The token has expired or was deleted.
- 4004: Protocol error. The server received a frame that it could not understand. For example, the
  content was not valid JSON, or was requesting an unknown operation, or a mandatory argument to an
  operation was missing.

The server also uses the
[pre-defined WebSocket status codes](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4).

### Protocol

A JSON-based protocol is used over the WebSocket connection to control which events are received by
the client.

#### Client Messages

The format of the messages sent by the client are all of the same format:

```json
{ "op": "<operation-name>", "data": <operation-specific-value> }
```

The "op" key is mandatory, and the value is either "subscribe" or "start". The "data" key is
mandatory for the "subscribe" operation.

The "subscribe" message ask the server to subscribe the client to the given event. When a message
with the same name is published on the "xivo" exchange of the bus, the server forwards the message
to all the subscribed clients that are authorized to receive it. For this command, the "data" value
is a dictionary with an "event_name" key (mandatory). Example:

```json
{ "op": "subscribe", "data": { "event_name": "endpoint_status_update" } }
```

You can subscribe to any event. The special event name `*` can be used to match all events.

See the [Events](/uc-doc/api_sdk/message_bus#bus-events) section for more
information on the events which are available by default on Wazo.

The "start" message ask the server to start sending messages from the bus to the client. Example:

```json
{ "op": "start" }
```

The server won't forward messages from the bus to the client until it receives the "start" message
from the client.

If the client send a message that the server doesn't understand, the server closes the connection.

The "ping" message asks the server to reply with a "pong" with the
same payload as what was sent by the ping.

```json
{ "op": "ping", "data": { "payload": "..." } }
```

#### Server Messages

The format of the messages sent by the server are all of the same format (until the server receives
a "start" command):

```json
{"op": "<operation-name>", "code": <status-code>, "data": "<data>"}
```

The 3 keys are always present. The value of the "op" key can be one of "init", "subscribe" or
"start". The value of the "code" key is an integer representing the status of the operation, 0
meaning there was no error, other values meaning there was an error.

The "init" message is only sent after the connection is successfully established between the client
and the server. It's code is always zero; if the connection could not be established, the connection
is simply closed. Example:

```json
{ "op": "init", "code": 0, "data": { "version": 2 } }
```

The "subscribe" message is sent as a response to a client "subscribe" message. The code is always
zero. Example:

```json
{ "op": "subscribe", "code": 0 }
```

The "start" message is sent as a response to a client "start" message. The code is always zero.
Example:

```json
{ "op": "start", "code": 0 }
```

The "pong" message is sent as a response to a client "ping" message.
The code is always zero. Example:

```json
{ "op": "pong", "code": 0, "data": { "payload": "..." } }
```

After receiving the "start" message, the server switch into the "bus/started" mode, where all
messages that the server will ever sent will be the body of the messages it received on the bus on
behalf of the client or replies to ping messages.
