## Bootstrapping

In order to be able to create users, groups and policies you have to be authenticated. The bootstrap
process allows the administrator to create a first user with the necessary rights to be able to add
other users.

### Preparing wazo-auth to be bootstrapped

To be able to bootstrap wazo-auth, you will have to enable the init plugin and create a key file in
wazo-auth's HOME directory. This can be done using the `wazo-auth-bootstrap` command.

```shell
wazo-auth-bootstrap setup && systemctl restart wazo-auth
```

### Bootstrapping wazo-auth

Once wazo-auth is ready to be bootstrapped, calling the init resource with a username, password and
the content of the key file will create a new user. The username and password can then be used to create
a token with the `auth.#` acl. This can be done using the `wazo-auth-bootstrap` command.

```shell
wazo-auth-bootstrap complete
```

This script will create a configuration file named `/root/.config/wazo-auth-cli/050-credentials.yml`
containing all necessary information to be used from the `wazo-auth-cli`.
