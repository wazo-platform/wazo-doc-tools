## Introduction

> _Interactive voice response (IVR) is a technology that allows a computer to interact with humans
> through the use of voice and DTMF tones input via keypad. In telecommunications, IVR allows
> customers to interact with a company's host system via a telephone keypad or by speech
> recognition, after which they can service their own inquiries by following the IVR dialogue._

> -- Wikipedia

This functionality is available via the [wazo-confd REST API](/uc-doc/api_sdk/rest_api/confd) or
using scripts, also named dialplan.

## Use Case: Minimal IVR

### Flowchart

### Configuration File and Dialplan

First step, you need to create a configuration file, that contain an asterisk context and your IVR
dialpan. In our example, both (file and context) are named
`/etc/asterisk/extensions_extra.d/dp-ivr-example.conf`.

Copy all these lines in the newly created configuration file (in our case, dp-ivr-example) :

```dialplan
[dp-ivr-example]

exten = s,1,NoOp(### dp-ivr-example.conf ###)
same = n,NoOp(Set the context containing your ivr destinations.)
same = n,Set(IVR_DESTINATION_CONTEXT=my-ivr-destination-context)
same = n,NoOp(Set the directory containing your ivr sounds.)
same = n,Set(GV_DIRECTORY_SOUNDS=/var/lib/wazo/sounds/ivr-sounds)
same = n,NoOp(the system answers the call and waits for 1 second before continuing)
same = n,Answer(1000)

same = n,NoOp(the system plays the first part of the audio file "welcome to ...")
same = n(first),Playback(${GV_DIRECTORY_SOUNDS}/ivr-example-welcome-sound)

same = n,NoOp(variable "counter" is set to 0)
same = n(beginning),Set(counter=0)

same = n,NoOp(variable "counter" is incremented and the label "start" is defined)
same = n(start),Set(counter=$[${counter} + 1])

same = n,NoOp(counter variable is now = ${counter})
same = n,NoOp(waiting for 1 second before reading the message that indicate all choices)
same = n,Wait(1)
same = n,NoOp(play the message ivr-example-choices that contain all choices)
same = n,Background(${GV_DIRECTORY_SOUNDS}/ivr-example-choices)
same = n,NoOp(waiting for DTMF during 5s)
same = n,Waitexten(5)

;##### CHOICE 1 #####
exten = 1,1,NoOp(pressed digit is 1, redirect to 8000 in ${IVR_DESTINATION_CONTEXT} context)
exten = 1,n,Goto(${IVR_DESTINATION_CONTEXT},8000,1)

;##### CHOICE 2 #####
exten = 2,1,NoOp(pressed digit is 2, redirect to 8833 in ${IVR_DESTINATION_CONTEXT} context)
exten = 2,n,Goto(${IVR_DESTINATION_CONTEXT},8833,1)

;##### CHOICE 3 #####
exten = 3,1,NoOp(pressed digit is 3, redirect to 8547 in ${IVR_DESTINATION_CONTEXT} context)
exten = 3,n,Goto(${IVR_DESTINATION_CONTEXT},8547,1)

;##### CHOICE 4 #####
exten = 4,1,NoOp(pressed digit is 4, redirect to start label in this context)
exten = 4,n,Goto(s,start)

;##### TIMEOUT #####
exten = t,1,NoOp(no digit pressed for 5s, process it like an error)
exten = t,n,Goto(i,1)

;##### INVALID CHOICE #####
exten = i,1,NoOp(if counter variable is 3 or more, then goto label "error")
exten = i,n,GotoIf($[${counter}>=3]?error)
exten = i,n,NoOp(pressed digit is invalid and less than 3 errors: the guide ivr-exemple-invalid-choice is now played)
exten = i,n,Playback(${GV_DIRECTORY_SOUNDS}/ivr-example-invalid-choice)
exten = i,n,Goto(s,start)
exten = i,n(error),Playback(${GV_DIRECTORY_SOUNDS}/ivr-example-error)
exten = i,n,Hangup()
```

### IVR external dial

To call the script dp-ivr-example from an external phone, you must create an incoming call and
redirect the call to the script dp-ivr-example with the commandÂ :

- `POST /extensions {"exten": <DID>, "context": "ctx-<tenant slug>-incall-<UUID>"}`
- `POST /incalls {"destination": {"type": "custom", "command": "Goto(dp-ivr-example,s,1)"}}`
- `PUT /incalls/{incall_id}/extensions/{extension_id}`

### IVR internal dial

To call the script dp-ivr-example from an internal phone you must create an entry in the default
context (`xivo-extrafeatures` is included in `ctx-<tenant slug>-internal-<UUID>`). The best way is
to add the extension in the file `/etc/asterisk/extensions_extra.d/xivo-extrafeatures.conf`.

```dialplan
exten => 8899,1,Goto(dp-ivr-example,s,1)
```

## Use Case: IVR with a schedule

In many cases, you need to associate your IVR to a schedule to indicate when your company is closed.

### Flowchart

### Create Schedule

First step, create your schedule. Give a name to your schedule and configure the open hours and
select the sound which is played when the company is closed.

In the Closed hours tab, configure all special closed days and select the sound that indicate to the
caller that the company is exceptionally closed.

The IVR script is now only available during workdays.

- `POST /schedules`
- `PUT /incalls/{incall_id}/schedules/{schedule_id}`

## Use Case: IVR with submenu

### Configuration File and Dialplan

Copy all these lines (2 contexts) in a configuration file on your Wazo server :

```dialplan
[dp-ivr-example]

exten = s,1,NoOp(### dp-ivr-example.conf ###)
same = n,NoOp(Set the context containing your ivr destinations.)
same = n,Set(IVR_DESTINATION_CONTEXT=my-ivr-destination-context)
same = n,NoOp(Set the directory containing your ivr sounds.)
same = n,Set(GV_DIRECTORY_SOUNDS=/var/lib/wazo/sounds/ivr-sounds)
same = n,NoOp(the system answers the call and waits for 1 second before continuing)
same = n,Answer(1000)

same = n,NoOp(the system plays the first part of the audio file "welcome to ...")
same = n(first),Playback(${GV_DIRECTORY_SOUNDS}/ivr-example-welcome-sound)

same = n,NoOp(variable "counter" is set to 0)
same = n(beginning),Set(counter=0)

same = n,NoOp(variable "counter" is incremented and the label "start" is defined)
same = n(start),Set(counter=$[${counter} + 1])

same = n,Wait(1)
same = n,NoOp(play the message ivr-example-choices that contain all choices)
