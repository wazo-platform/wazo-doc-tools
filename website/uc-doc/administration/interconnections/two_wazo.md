title: Interconnect two Wazo directly
---

Interconnecting two Wazo will allow you to send and receive calls between the users configured on
both sides.

The steps to configure the interconnections are:

- Establish the trunk between the two Wazo, that is the SIP connection between the two servers
- Configure outgoing calls on the server(s) used to emit calls
- Configure incoming calls on the server(s) used to receive calls

For now, only SIP interconnections have been tested.

## Establish the trunk

The settings below allow a trunk to be used in both directions, so it doesn't matter which server is
A and which is B.

Consider Wazo A wants to establish a trunk with Wazo B.

- `POST /trunks {"context": <see below>}`
- `POST /endpoints/sip {"username": "wazo-trunk", "secret": "pass", "type": "friend", "host": "dynamic"}`
- `PUT /trunks/{trunk_id}/endpoints/sip/{sip_id}`

The `context` field will determine which extensions will be reachable by the other side of the
trunk:

- If `context` is set to `ctx-<tenant slug>-internal-<UUID>`, then every user, group, conf room,
  queue, etc. that have an extension in the `ctx-<tenant slug>-internal-<UUID>` context will be
  reachable directly by the other end of the trunk. This setting can ease configuration if you
  manage both ends of the trunk.
- If you are establishing a trunk with a provider, you probably don't want everything to be
  available to everyone else, so you can set the `context` field to
  `ctx-<tenant slug>-incall-<UUID>`. By default, there is no extension available in this context, so
  we will be able to configure which extension are reachable by the other end. This is the role of
  the incoming calls: making bridges from the `ctx-<tenant slug>-incall-<UUID>` context to other
  contexts.

On Wazo A, create the other end of the SIP trunk:

- `POST /trunks {"context": "ctx-<tenant slug>-incall-<UUID>"}`
- `POST /endpoints/sip {"username": "wazo-trunk", "secret": "pass", "type": "friend", "host": <Wazo B IP address or hostname>}`
- `PUT /trunks/{trunk_id}/endpoints/sip/{sip_id}`
- `POST /registers/sip {"auth_username": "wazo-trunk", "auth_password": "pass", "transport": "udp", "remote_host": <Wazo B IP address or hostname>}`
- `PUT /trunks/{trunk_id}/registers/sip/{sip_id}`

On both Wazo, activate some codecs:

- `PUT /asterisk/sip/general {..., "allow": "gsm", ...}`

At that point, the Asterisk command `sip show registry` on Wazo B should print a line showing that
Wazo A is registered, meaning your trunk is established.

## Set the outgoing calls

The outgoing calls configuration will allow Wazo to know which extensions will be called through the
trunk.

On the call emitting server(s), add outgoing call.

- `POST /outcalls`
- `PUT /outcalls/{outcall_id}/trunks`
- `POST /extensions {"exten": "_**99.", "context": "ctx-<tenant slug>-outcall-<UUID>"}`
- `PUT /outcalls/{outcall_id}/extensions/{extension_id} {"strip_digits": 4}`

This will tell Wazo: if any extension begins with `**99`, then try to dial it on the trunk
`wazo-trunk`, after removing the 4 first characters (the `**99` prefix).

The most useful special characters to match extensions are:

- `_` (underscore): tells Asterisk that this is a pattern
- `.` (period): will match one or more characters
- `X`: will match only one character

You can find more details about pattern matching in Asterisk (hence in Wazo) on
[the Asterisk wiki](https://docs.asterisk.org/Configuration/Dialplan/Pattern-Matching).

## Set the incoming calls

Now that we have calls going out from a Wazo, we need to route incoming calls on the Wazo
destination.

**Note**: This step is only necessary if the trunk is linked to an Incoming calls context.

To route an incoming call to the right destination in the right context, we will create an incoming
call

- `POST /extensions {"exten": "101", "context": "ctx-<tenant slug>-incall-<UUID>"}`
- `POST /incalls {"destination": {"type": "user", "user_id": <someone_id>}}`
- `PUT /incalls/{incall_id}/extensions/{extension_id}`

This will tell Wazo: if you receive an incoming call to the extension `101` in the context
`ctx-<tenant slug>-incall-<UUID>`, then route it to the user `someone_id`. The destination context
will be found automatically, depending on the context of the line of the given user.

So, with the outgoing call set earlier on Wazo A, and with the incoming call above set on Wazo B, a
user on Wazo A will dial `**99101`, and the user `someone_id` will ring on Wazo B.
