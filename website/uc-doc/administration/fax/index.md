## Fax reception

### Adding a fax reception DID

If you want to receive faxes from Wazo, you need to add incoming calls definition with the
`Application` destination and the `fax_to_mail` application for every DID you want to receive faxes
from.

This applies even if you want the action to be different from sending an email, like putting it on a
FTP server. You'll still need to enter an email address in these cases even though it won't be used.

### Changing the email body

You can change the body of the email sent upon fax reception by editing `/etc/xivo/mail.txt`.

The following variable can be included in the mail body:

- `%(dstnum)s`: the DID that received the fax

If you want to include a regular percent character, i.e. `%`, you must write it as `%%` in
`mail.txt` or an error will occur when trying to do the variables substitution.

The `agid` service must be restarted to apply changes:

```shell
service wazo-agid restart
```

### Changing the email subject

You can change the subject of the email sent upon fax reception by editing
`/etc/xivo/asterisk/xivo_fax.conf`.

Look for the `[mail]` section, and in this section, modify the value of the `subject` option.

The available variable substitution are the same as for the email body.

The `agid` service must be restarted to apply changes:

```shell
service wazo-agid restart
```

### Changing the email from

You can change the from of the email sent upon fax reception by editing
`/etc/xivo/asterisk/xivo_fax.conf`.

Look for the `[mail]` section, and in this section, modify the value of the `email_from` option.

The `agid` service must be restarted to apply changes:

```shell
service wazo-agid restart
```

### Changing the email realname

You can change the `realname` of the email sent upon fax reception by editing
`/etc/xivo/asterisk/xivo_fax.conf`.

Look for the `[mail]` section, and in this section, modify the value of the `email_realname` option.

The `agid` service must be restarted to apply changes:

```shell
service wazo-agid restart
```

### Using the advanced features

The following features are only available via the `/etc/xivo/asterisk/xivo_fax.conf` configuration
file.

The way it works is the following:

- you first declare some backends, i.e. actions to be taken when a fax is received. A backend name
  looks like `mail`, `ftp_example_org` or `printer_office`.
- once your backends are defined, you can use them in your destination numbers. For example, when
  someone calls the DID 100, you might want the `ftp_example_org` and `mail` backend to be run, but
  otherwise, you only want the `mail` backend to be run.

Here's an example of a valid `/etc/xivo/asterisk/xivo_fax.conf` configuration file:

```ini
[general]
tiff2pdf = /usr/bin/tiff2pdf
mutt = /usr/bin/mutt
lp = /usr/bin/lp

[mail]
subject = FAX reception to %(dstnum)s
content_file = /etc/xivo/mail.txt
email_from = no-reply+fax@wazo.community
email_realname = Service Fax

[ftp_example_org]
host = example.org
username = foo
password = bar
directory = /foobar

[dstnum_default]
dest = mail

[dstnum_100]
dest = mail, ftp_example_org
```

The section named `dstnum_default` will be used only if no DID-specific actions are defined.

After editing `/etc/xivo/asterisk/xivo_fax.conf`, you need to restart the agid server for the
changes to be applied:

```shell
service wazo-agid restart
```

#### Using the FTP backend {#fax-ftp}

The FTP backend is used to send a PDF version of the received fax to an FTP server.

An FTP backend is always defined in a section beginning with the `ftp` prefix. Here's an example for
a backend named `ftp_example_org`:

```ini
[ftp_example_org]
host = example.org
port = 2121
username = foo
password = bar
directory = /foobar
convert_to_pdf = 0
```

The `port` option is optional and defaults to 21.

The `directory` option is optional and if not specified, the document will be put in the user's root
directory.

The `convert_to_pdf` option is optional and defaults to 1. If it is set to 0, the TIFF file will not
be converted to PDF before being sent to the FTP server.

The uploaded file are named like `${WAZO_SRCNUM}-${EPOCH}.pdf`.

### Using the printer backend

To use the printer backend, you must have the `cups-client` package installed on your Wazo:

```shell
apt-get install cups-client
```

The printer backend uses the `lp` command to print faxes.

A printer backend is always defined in a section beginning with the `printer` prefix. Here's an
example for a backend named `printer_office`:

```ini
[printer_office]
name = office
convert_to_pdf = 1
```

When a fax will be received, the system command `lp -d office <faxfile>` will be executed.

The `convert_to_pdf` option is optional and defaults to 1. If it is set to 0, the TIFF file will not
be converted to PDF before being printed.

**Warning**: You need a CUPS server set up somewhere on your network.

#### Using the mail backend

By default, a mail backend named `mail` is defined. You can define more mail backends if you want.
Just look what the default mail backend looks like.

## Fax detection

Wazo **does not currently support Fax Detection**. A workaround is described in the `fax-detection`
section.

## Using analog gateways {#fax-analog-gateway}

Wazo is able to provision Cisco SPA122 and Linksys SPA2102, SPA3102 and SPA8000 analog gateways
which can be used to connect fax equipments. This section describes the creation of custom template
_for SPA3102_ which modifies several parameters.

**Note**: **With SPA ATA plugins >= v0.8**, you **should not need** to follow this section anymore
since all of these parameters are now set in the base templates of all, except for
`Echo_Canc_Adapt_Enable`, `Echo_Supp_Enable`, `Echo_Canc_Enable`.

**Note**: Be aware that most of the parameters are or could be country specific, i.e. :

- Preferred Codec,
- FAX Passthru Codec,
- RTP Packet Size,
- RTP-Start-Loopback Codec,
- Ring Waveform,
- Ring Frequency,
- Ring Voltage,
- FXS Port Impedance

1. Create a custom template for the SPA3102 base template:

   ```shell
   cd /var/lib/wazo-provd/plugins/xivo-cisco-spa3102-5.1.10/var/templates/
   cp ../../templates/base.tpl .
   ```

2. Add the following content before the `</flat-profile>` tag:

   ```jinja2

   ```

3. Reconfigure the devices with:

   ```shell
   wazo-provd-cli -c 'devices.using_plugin("xivo-cisco-spa3102-5.1.10").reconfigure()'
   ```

4. Then reboot the devices:

   ```shell
   wazo-provd-cli -c 'devices.using_plugin("xivo-cisco-spa3102-5.1.10").synchronize()'
   ```

Most of this template can be copy/pasted for a SPA2102 or SPA8000.
