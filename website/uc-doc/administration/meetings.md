## Purpose

A Meeting allows users to get in conference with other people that are not using Wazo directly. In
other words, users can create meetings and give a Web URL to anybody to join them in a Web
conference.

## Prerequisites

To achieve this feature, there are some prerequisites:

- Wazo Platform server 21.14 or above
- A web application for Wazo users, e.g. `https://users.wazo.example.com`
  - You must build your own application for this,
    [wazo-webrtc-demo](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-webrtc-demo) may be a good starting
    point.
- A web application for external users, e.g. `https://guests.wazo.example.com`
  - Likewise, you must build your own application. The application can be the same as for Wazo
    users.
- A HTTP Ingress configured on the server: that is the public address of the Wazo Platform server
  that will be given to external users to contact your server:

  ```http
  POST https://wazo.example.com/api/confd/1.1/ingresses/http
  Wazo-Tenant: 74f8a451-2b38-4b74-bdfe-8137688cc1e5

  {
    "uri": "https://wazo.example.com"
  }
  ```

  Please note: this URI is the hostname of the Wazo Platform API server, which may be different than
  the user applications `users.wazo.example.com` and `guests.wazo.example.com`.

- For video meetings, you need to enable `video_mode=sfu` in the global conferences bridge settings:

  ```http
  PUT https://wazo.example.com/api/confd/1.1/asterisk​/confbridge​/wazo_default_bridge

  {
    ...
    "video_mode": "sfu",
    ...
  }
  ```

## Use case

User Alice wants to talk with her friend Ethan, who does not use Wazo Platform.

The sequence will look like:

![Sequence Diagram](/images/uc-doc/administration/meetings.svg)

1. Alice logs in at `https://users.wazo.example.com/...` and creates a Meeting:

   ```http
   POST https://wazo.example.com/api/confd/1.1/users/me/meetings

   {
     "name": "Meeting with Ethan"
   }
   ```

1. Alice then gets the following information to share with Ethan:

   - The Meeting UUID
   - The Wazo Platform server public URI, taken from the configured HTTP Ingress.
   - SIP credentials to place a call on the Wazo Platform server

1. Alice's application then encodes those information into a single Web URL, showing the resulting
   URL to Alice, starting with `https://guests.wazo.example.com/...`.

1. Alice then calls the Meeting to wait for Ethan, by calling the extension found in the response of
   the `POST`

1. Alice may then share the Web URL with Ethan, so that Ethan can join Alice in the conference.

1. Ethan opens the Web URL, opening the web application at `https://guests.wazo.example.com/...`.
   The web application can then join the Meeting with WebRTC, by using the server public URI and SIP
   credentials and dialing the extension `meeting-guest`.

1. Alice now sees Ethan in the conference and they can enjoy their time together.

1. Once they are done, Alice can delete the Meeting:

   ```http
   DELETE https://wazo.example.com/api/confd/1.1/users/me/meetings/21142baa-4318-4d80-a93f-c403a47192b5
   ```

## Other scenarios

- Any meeting is automatically deleted 48h after its creation. Any participant still present in the
  Meeting at this time will be hung up.
- The meetings can be used by any SIP phone. However, the SIP device needs to be able to dial
  non-digit extensions like `meeting-guest`.

## Limitations

- Meetings are limited to 100 participants at a time
