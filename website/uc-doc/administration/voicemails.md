## General Configuration {#voicemail-general-configuration}

The global voicemail configuration is provided by `/asterisk/voicemail` endpoints

To customize the email sent when a voicemail is received, you can use a few variables. The complete
list is available on the
[Asterisk wiki](https://docs.asterisk.org/Configuration/Dialplan/Variables/Channel-Variables/Asterisk-Standard-Channel-Variables/VoiceMail-Channel-Variables/).

## Deleting a voicemail

- Deleting a voicemail is irreversible. It deletes all messages associated with that voicemail.
- If the voicemail contains messages, the message waiting indication on the phone will not be
  deactivated until the next phone reboot.

## Disable password checking

Unchecking the option `ask_password` field allows you to skip password checking for the voicemail
only when it is consulted from an internal context.

- when calling the voicemail with `*98`
- when calling the voicemail with `*99<voicemail number>`

**Warning**: If the `*99` extension is enabled and a user does not have a password on its voicemail,
anyone from the same context will be able to listen to its messages, change its password and
greeting messages.

**Warning**: For security reasons, an incoming call with
`{"destination": {"appplication: "voicemail"}` with the same context as the voicemail should be
avoided if a voicemail has no password.
