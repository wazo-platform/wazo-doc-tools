  Only 1 audio channel must be present per file, i.e. files must be in mono.

  If your music on hold files don't seem to work, you should look for errors in the asterisk logs.

  The on-hold music will always play from the start.

- **mp3**: play MP3 files. The on-hold music will play from an arbitrary position on the track, it
  will not play from the start.

  **Warning**: The mp3 mode is deprecated and you should not use it. Instead, you should convert
  your MP3 files to another format and use the "files" mode.

- **custom**: Do not play sound files. Instead, run an external process. That process must send on
  stdout the same binary format than WAV files.

  Example process:

  ```shell
  /usr/bin/mpg123 -s --mono -y -f 8192 -r 8000 http://streaming.example.com/stream.mp3
  ```

  **Note**: Processes run by custom categories are started as soon as the category is created and
  will only stop when the category is deleted. This means that on-hold music fed from online
  streaming will constantly be receiving network traffic, even when there are no calls.
