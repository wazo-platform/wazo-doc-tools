title: Paging
---

With Wazo, you can define paging (i.e. intercom) extensions to page a group of users. When calling a
paging extension, the phones of the specified users will auto-answer, if they support it.

You can manage your paging with `/pagings` endpoints

When adding a new paging extension, the number can be any numeric value; to call it, you just need
to prefix the paging number with `*11`.
