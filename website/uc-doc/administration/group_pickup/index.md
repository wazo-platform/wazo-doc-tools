title: Group Pickup
---

Pickup groups allow users to intercept calls directed towards other users of the group. This is done
either by dialing a special extension or by pressing a function key.

## Quick Summary

In order to be able to use group pickup you have to:

- Create a pickup group
- Enable an extension to intercept calls
- Add a function key to interceptors

## Creating a Pickup Group

- `POST /callpickups`
- `POST /callpickups/{callpickup_id}/interceptors/groups`
- `POST /callpickups/{callpickup_id}/interceptors/users`
- `POST /callpickups/{callpickup_id}/targets/groups`
- `POST /callpickups/{callpickup_id}/targets/users`

## Enabling an Interception Extension

The pickup extension can be defined with:

- `/asterisk/features/general` endpoint and the option key `pickupexten`

The default value for group pickup is `*8`.

**Warning**: The directed pickup extension must be enabled when a function key is used.

If you decide to not use a directed pickup extension, only `*8` alone will work (without specifying
the extension to pickup). In this case, you _must_ have at least a pickup group with the targets and
interceptors you want for the interception to work. This will also make it impossible for the
function keys to work. See [Directed Pickup](/uc-doc/administration/directed_pickup) for more
information.

## Adding a Function Key to an Interceptor

Assign a function to an interceptor of type `pickup`
