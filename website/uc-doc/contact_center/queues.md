title: Queues
---

Call queues are used to distribute calls to the agents subscribed to the queue. Queues are managed
with the `/queues` endpoints

A queue can be configured with the following options:

A `options: strategy` defines how queue members are called when a call enters the queue. A queue can
use one of the following ring strategies:

- `linear`: For each call, in the same order, starting from the same member
  - For agents: In login order
  - For static members: In definition order
- `leastrecent`: call the member who least recently hung up a call
- `fewestcalls`: call the member with the fewest completed calls
- `rrmemory` (round robin with memory): call the "next" member after the one who answered last
- `random`: call a member at random
- `wrandom` (weight random): same as random, but taking the member penalty into account
- `ringall`: call all members at the same time

**Warning**: When editing a queue, you can't change the ring strategy to linear. This is due to an
asterisk limitation. Unfortunately, if you want to change the ring strategy of a queue to linear,
you'll have to delete it first and then create a new queue with the right strategy.

**Note**: When an agent is a member of many queues the order of call distribution between multiple
queues is non-deterministic and cannot be configured.

## Timers

You may control how long a call will stay in a queue using different timers:

- `options: timeout` (Member reachability time out): Maximum number of seconds a call will ring on
  an agent's phone. If a call is not answered within this time, the call will be forwarded to
  another agent.
- `retry_on_timeout` (Time before retrying a call to a member): Used once a call has reached the
  "Member reachability time out". The call will be put on hold for the number of seconds allowed
  before being redirected to another agent.
- `timeout` (Ringing time): The total time the call will stay in the queue.
- `options: timeoutpriority` (Timeout priority): Determines which timeout to use before ending a
  call. When set to "configuration", the call will use the "Member reachability time out". When set
  to "dialplan", the call will use the "Ringing time".

## Fallbacks

Calls can be diverted on no answer with `/queues/{queue_id}/fallbacks` endpoints:

- `noanswer_destination`: The call reached the `timeout` and no agent answered the call.
- `congestion_destination`: The number of calls waiting has reached the `options: maxlen`.
- `fail_destination`: No agent was available to answer the call when the call entered the queue
  (`options: joinempty`) or the call was queued and no agents were available to answer
  (`options: leavewhenempty`).

## Diversions

Diversions can be used to redirect calls to another destination when a queue is very busy. Calls are
redirected using one of the two threshold: `wait_ratio_threshold` and `·∫Åait_time_threshold`

The diversion check is done only once per call, before the
[preprocess subroutine](/uc-doc/api_sdk/subroutine) is executed and before the call enters the
queue.

### `wait_time_threshold`

When this scenario is used, the administrator can set a destination for calls to be sent to when the
estimated waiting time is over the threshold `wait_time_threshold`.

Note that if a new call arrives when there are no waiting calls in the queue, the call will
**always** be allowed to enter the queue.

**Note**:

- this _estimated_ waiting time is computed from the **actual hold time** of all **answered** calls
  in the queue (since last asterisk restart) according to an
  [exponential smoothing formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing)
- the estimated waiting time of a queue is updated only when a queue member answers a call.

### `wait_ratio_threshold` {#queue-diversion-waitratio}

When this scenario is used, the administrator can set a destination for calls to be sent to when the
number of waiting calls per logged-in agent is over the `wait_ratio_threshold`.

The number of waiting calls includes the call for which the check is currently being performed.

The number of logged-in agents is the sum of user members and currently logged-in agent members. An
agent only needs to be logged in and a member of the queue to participate towards the count of
logged-in agents, regardless of whether he is available, on call, on pause or on wrapup.

The maximum number of waiting calls per logged-in agent can have a fractional part.

Here are a few examples:

```
wait_ratio_threshold: 1
Current number of waiting calls: 2
Current number of logged-in agents: 2
Number of waiting calls per logged-in agent when a new call arrives: 3 / 2 = 1.5
Call will be redirected to ``wait_ratio_destination``
```

```
wait_ratio_threshold: 0.5
Number of waiting calls: 5
Number of logged-in agents: 12
Number of waiting calls per logged-in agent when a new call arrives: 6 / 12 = 0.5
Call will not be redirected to ``wait_ratio_destination``
```

Note that if a new call arrives when there are no waiting calls in the queue, the call will
**always** be allowed to enter the queue. For example, in the following scenario:

```
wait_ratio_threshold: 0.5
Current number of waiting calls: 0
Current number of logged-in agents: 1
Number of waiting calls per logged-in agent when a new call arrives: 1 / 1 = 1
```

Even if `wait_ratio_time` (1) is greater than the maximum (0.5), the call will still be accepted
since there are currently no waiting calls.

## Music on Hold {#moh}

The `music_on_hold` of the queue will be played:

- When the caller is waiting to be answered.
- When the caller is put on hold by an agent who already answered.

If you want a different music to be played when the caller is put on hold after being answered, you
need to make some more configuration:

1. Write an AGI script that will set the channel variable `CHANNEL(musicclass)` to the name of the
   music-on-hold class you want the caller to hear when he is put on hold by the agent. Save this
   script to e.g. `/usr/local/bin/agi-agent-hold-moh`.
2. Add the following [preprocess subroutine](/uc-doc/api_sdk/subroutine) on the queue:

   ```dialplan
   [setup-agent-hold-moh]
   exten = s,1,NoOp(Setting AGI script for custom agent hold music)
   same  =   n,Set(XIVO_QUEUEAGI=/usr/local/bin/agi-agent-hold-moh)
   same  =   n,Return
   ```

This configuration will give the following scenario:

- The caller calls the queue
- The caller hears the music on hold of the queue
- The agent answers the call
- Wazo calls the AGI script, setting the new music on hold
- The caller and the agent talk together
- The agent puts the caller on hold
- The caller hears the new music on hold, set by the AGI script
