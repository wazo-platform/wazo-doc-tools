title: REST API Permissions
sidebar_label: Permissions (ACLs)
---

The tokens delivered by [wazo-auth](/uc-doc/system/wazo-auth/introduction/) have a list of
permissions associated (ACL), that determine which REST resources are authorized for this token.
Each REST resource has an associated required ACL. When you try to access to a REST resource, this
resource requests wazo-auth with your token and the required ACL to validate the access.

## Syntax

An ACL contains 3 parts separated by dot (`.`)

- `service`: name of service, without prefix `xivo-` (e.g. `wazo-confd` -> `confd`).
- `resource`: name of resource separated by dot (`.`) (e.g. `/users/17/lines` -> `users.17.lines`).
- `action`: action performed on resource. Generally, this is the following schema:

  - `get` -> `read`
  - `put` -> `update`
  - `post` -> `create`
  - `delete` -> `delete`

### Substitutions

There are 3 substitution values for an ACL.

- `*`: replace only one word between dot.
- `#`: replace one or multiple words.
- `me`: replace the `user_uuid` from sent token.

### Example

The ACL `confd.users.me.#.read` will have access to the following REST resources:

```
GET /users/{user_id}/cti
GET /users/{user_id}/funckeys
GET /users/{user_id}/funckeys/{position}
GET /users/{user_id}/funckeys/templates
GET /users/{user_id}/lines
GET /users/{user_id}/lines/{line_id}
GET /users/{user_id}/voicemail
```

- `service`: `confd`
- `resource`: `users.me.#`
- `action`: `read`

The ACL `confd.users.me.funckeys.*.*` will have access to the following REST resources:

```
DELETE /users/{user_id}funckeys/{position}
GET /users/{user_id}funckeys/{position}
PUT /users/{user_id}funckeys/{position}
GET /users/{user_id}funckeys/templates
```

- `service`: `confd`
- `resource`: `users.me.funckeys.*`
- `action`: `*`

Where `{user_id}` is the user uuid from the token.

## Available ACLs

The ACL corresponding to each resource is documented in [auth.wazo.community](https://auth.wazo.community). Some
resources may not have any associated ACL yet, so you must use `{service}.#` instead.
