title: User Management
---

The purpose of this page is to explain how to set up a fully operational “telephony” user (with the
Wazo API), having the following features/properties:

- Voicemail enabled
- Forward enabled
- Credentials for API usage
- One or more lines (including extensions and SIP endpoints) created
- One or more created DID numbers that allow(s) receiving calls
- Member of a ring groups
- …

Want more information about the user's API, consult the
[API documentation](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/users/operation/create_user).

## Create User (the new way)

To help developers quickly create users and easily understand the information needed, the user
creation process has been revamped. This allows developers to use one single endpoint, instead of
having to call many endpoints. Also, relations and complete validation/rollback are handled on the
server-side:

- the attachments (the link between the user and their related resources)
- the rollback in case of errors (if one of the resource creations fails)

**Warning**: If needed, the following resources must be created before user creation:

- Switchboards
- Groups
- Functions Keys Templates

Below is the only step to create the user.

### A Single `POST` Request

- Create the “telephony” user and all the required resources needed to be fully operational
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/users/operation/create_user)):
  ```markdown
  POST /users
  ```
  Voilà! The user and related resources will be created from this single endpoint. If the payload is
  not right, nothing will be created and you will receive a complete error message.

## Create User (the old way)

The Wazo REST API historically provides HTTP endpoints helping developers to manage resources at a
very low level (i.e. developers manage the resources, one by one). For example: to create a fully
operational “telephony” user, developers must query various endpoints (and so many resources) in a
specific order:

- /users
- /lines
- /extensions
- /voicemails
- …

The following requests must be made in the specific chronological order:

### User

- Create the core of the “telephony” user
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/users/operation/create_user)):
  ```markdown
  POST /users
  ```

### Line(s)

- Create line
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/lines/operation/create_line)):

  ```markdown
  POST /lines
  ```

- Attach the line to the user
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/users/operation/associate_user_line)):
  ```markdown
  PUT /users/<user_id>/lines/<line_id>
  ```

### SIP Endpoint(s)

- Create SIP endpoint
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/endpoints/operation/create_endpoint_sip)):

  ```markdown
  POST /endpoints/sip
  ```

- Attach trunk to SIP endpoint
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/endpoints/operation/associate_trunk_endpoint_sip)):

  ```markdown
  POST /trunks/<trunk_id>/endpoints/sip/<sip_uuid>
  ```

- Attach endpoint to line
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/lines/operation/associate_line_endpoint_sip)):
  ```markdown
  PUT /lines/<line_id>/endpoints/sip/<endpoint_uuid>
  ```

### Extension(s)

- Create extension
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/extensions/operation/create_line_extension)):

  ```markdown
  POST /extensions
  ```

- Attach extension to line
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/extensions/operation/associate_line_extension)):
  ```markdown
  PUT /lines/<line_id>/extensions/<extension_id>
  ```

### Voicemail(s)

  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/voicemails/operation/create_voicemail)):

  ```markdown
  POST /voicemails
  ```

- Attach voicemail to user
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/users/operation/associate_user_voicemail)):
  ```markdown
  PUT /users/<user_id>/voicemails/<voicemail_id>
  ```

### Forward(s)

- Define all forwards for user (remove existing user’s forwards)
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/users/operation/update_user_forwards)):
  ```markdown
  PUT /users/<user_id>/forwards
  ```

### Fallback(s)

- Define all fallbacks for user (remove existing user’s fallbacks)
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/users/operation/update_user_fallback)):
  ```markdown
  PUT /users/<user_id>/fallbacks
  ```

### Agent(s)

- Create agent
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/agents/operation/create_agent)):

  ```markdown
  POST /agents
  ```

- Attach agent to user
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/users/operation/associate_user_agent)):
  ```markdown
  PUT /users/<user_id>/agents/<agent_id>
  ```

### Group(s) ( including ring group(s) )

- Create group having some users as members (including the new user)
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/groups/operation/create_group)):
  ```markdown
  POST /groups
  ```

OR

- Define existing groups for user (this will detach any existing groups already attached to the
  user)
  ([API Reference](/documentation/api/configuration.html#tag/users/operation/update_user_groups)):
  ```markdown
  PUT /users/<user_id>/groups
  ```

OR

    ```markdown
    GET /switchboards/<switchboard_uuid>
    ```

  POST /queues
