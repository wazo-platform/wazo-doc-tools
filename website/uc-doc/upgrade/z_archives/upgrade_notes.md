## 2020

### 20.17 {#20-17}

- The recording files for online recording, i.e. recording started during a call, are now stored at
  `/var/lib/wazo/sounds/tenants/*/monitor`. Old recordings are available at
  `/var/spool/asterisk/monitor/` and must be moved manually to the new path.

### 20.16 {#20-16}

- The `i386` (32 bits) architecture is now deprecated and will be removed in 21.01 from our debian
  repository and CI. See [Migrate from i386 to amd64](/uc-doc/upgrade/migrate_i386_to_amd64) for
  more information.
- wazo-auth ACL template feature has been removed. There are no more rendering template that will be

for more information.

### 20.13 {#20-13}

- The SIP endpoint configuration has been changed to reflect the Asterisk configuration file. If you
  are using one of the following API, you should update your application to the new body of the
  response before upgrading.

  - `GET /api/confd/1.1/endpoints/sip`
  - `GET /api/confd/1.1/endpoints/sip/<id>`
  - `GET /api/confd/1.1/users/<id>/lines/main/associated/endpoints/sip`
  - `GET /api/confd/1.1/users/<id>/lines/<id>/associated/endpoints/sip`

- The ID field of a SIP endpoint is now a UUID instead of a numerical ID.

- The generated SIP configuration file has changed. If you did manual configuration, your changes
  have to be reviewed to match the new format. If you use a file to add options, you will be able to
  add all options to your endpoint configuration. All options are now available through the API.
  Here is a list of the changes:

  - The name of the registration sections has changed

- The general SIP configuration used to be shared by all tenants. A new template has been created
  for each tenant based on the old general SIP configuration. This new template is labeled `global`
  and can be used to change the configuration of lines and trunks within a tenant.

- When creating a line or a tenant you should use the `global` template if you want your new
  resource to inherit from the `global` SIP configuration of your tenant.

### 20.09 {#20-09}

- The wazo-confgend module that generates the SIP configuration for `chan_sip` has been removed. If
  you are still using `chan_sip` you will have to remove your custom configuration to use `pjsip`.

- The TLS configuration has been deprecated on the following services. You should always use NGINX
  to proxy communication with wazo-platform services. To follow this change, the listen address has
  been changed to 127.0.0.1 by default.

      listen: <ip>
      port: <port>
      certificate: </path/to/cert>
      private_key: </path/to/key>
  ```

  becomes:

  rest_api:
    listen: <ip>
    port: <port>
    certificate: </path/to/cert>
    private_key: </path/to/key>
  ```

- The TLS configuration has been deprecated on the following services. You should always use NGINX
  to proxy communication with wazo-platform services. To follow this change, the listen address has
  been changed to 127.0.0.1 by default.

  - wazo-amid

- There is now an API to manage SIP transports. This means that the transport of a SIP endpoint is
  not predefined anymore. If you relied on the fact that a SIP endpoint used the transport `wss` to
  know whether or not it is a WebRTC endpoint you should change your logic to check if `webrtc`
  equals to `yes`.

Consult the
[20.05 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D20.05)
for more information.

### 20.04 {#20-04}

- The PJSIP `Global` and `System` configuration options are now configured using
  `/1.1/asterisk/pjsip/global` and `/1.1/asterisk/pjsip/system`. Options added to the
  `/1.1/asterisk/sip/general` that used to be mapped to one of these sections have been migrated to
  the new API and the mapping from chan_sip to chan_pjsip has been removed for those 2 sections.

Consult the
[20.04 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D20.04)
for more information.

### 20.03 {#20-03}

- The email template in wazo-auth now use the incoming HTTP request host and port to fill the
  template instead of the service discovery configuration. If you have a customized template that
  inconditionally uses the port it should be modified for cases where the port is not used.
- The `xivo-aastra-2.6.0.2019` phone provisioning plugin has been removed. The decision was made
  after it was discovered that the firmware was nowhere to be found. If you still want to use it, it
  is in the `archive` phone plugin repository.

Consult the
[20.03 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D20.03)

[20.02 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D20.02)
for more information.

### 20.01 {#20-01}

- The default protocol configured for consul is now `HTTP` instead of `HTTPS` since it's only
  available on `localhost`. The `HTTPS` remains available via the port `8501`.

Consult the
[20.01 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D20.01)
for more information.

## 2019

### 19.17 {#19-17}

- The default Ansible installation installs the development version of Wazo Platform. If you have
  not changed the `wazo_distribution_upgrade` variable, all the subsequent upgrades will stay on the
  development version. This is the expected behavior, but it was not visible in the installation
  procedure. To make your Wazo Platform use the stable version, use the following command:

  ```shell
  wazo-dist -m pelican-buster
  ```

  This command will take effect at the next Wazo Platform upgrade.

- `wazo-dird` phone plugins have been migrated to `wazo-phoned`. If you used the phone routes from
  `wazo-dird` directly, you must use the new routes in `wazo-phoned`.
- The conference rooms created in Wazo 18.03 or before (using asterisk `meetme` module) will not
  work anymore because they rely on DAHDI. If you were still using those conference rooms, you must
  create new conference rooms using the conferences API or the `wazo-ui` interface.
- `DAHDI` is not longer a mandatory dependency of Wazo: it will not be installed on new installs
  anymore. Upgraded Wazo Platform will keep DAHDI installed if it was configured in
  `/etc/asterisk/dahdi_channels.conf`. Otherwise, DAHDI will be removed.
- Some dependencies have been removed from the `asterisk` package. If you used one of the following
  modules you must install the `wazo-asterisk-extra-modules` to keep using those modules. Note that
  all modules listed here are disabled by default on Wazo. You have to manually modify
  `/etc/asterisk/modules.conf` to use them.
  - `app_jack`
  - `cdr_pgsql`
  - `cdr_radius`
  - `cdr_tds`
  - `cel_radius`
  - `cel_tds`
  - `chan_also`
  - `chan_console`
  - `chan_mgcp`
  - `chan_motif`
  - `chan_oss`
  - `chan_phone`
  - `chan_skinny`
  - `chan_unistim`
  - `res_calendar_caldav`
  - `res_calendar_ews`
  - `res_calendar_exchange`
  - `res_calendar_icalendar`
  - `res_calendar`
  - `res_snmp`
  - `res_xmpp`

Consult the
[19.17 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D19.17)
for more information.

### 19.16 {#19-16}

- `xivo-amid-client` has been renamed to `wazo-amid-client`
- `wazo-auth` http configuration section have been moved onto the `rest_api` section, eg:

  ```yaml
  rest_api:
    https:
      listen: <ip>
      port: <port>
      certificate: </path/to/cert>
      private_key: </path/to/key>
  ```

  becomes:

  ```yaml
  rest_api:
    listen: <ip>
    port: <port>
    certificate: </path/to/cert>
    private_key: </path/to/key>
  ```

- The default value for Asterisk PJSIP configuration parameter `rtptimeout` has been set to 7200
  seconds on new installs only. The change was done to automatically delete ghost calls that might
  get stuck. If you wish to modify this value, use the `/asterisk/sip/general` endpoint in
  `wazo-confd` API.

Consult the
[19.16 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D19.16)
for more information.

### 19.15 {#19-15}

- We have standardize the stevedore entry point namespace for our python client. If you have custom
  plugins, Be sure to use the full client name for the namespace. (e.g. `auth_client.commands` -->
  `wazo_auth_client.commands`)
- The directed call pickup extension `*8XXXX` has been disabled by default on new installations,
  because it made it possible for any user to pickup any other user, including users for whom it
  should not be possible. This does not apply to upgrades, but if you wish to disable this feature,
  you can do it with `wazo-confd` `/extensions/features` API endpoint.

[19.15 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D19.15)
for more information.

### 19.14 {#19-14}

- A new version (v2) of websocket protocol has been created. See
  [Wazo WebSocket](/uc-doc/api_sdk/websocket) for more information

  The v1 is now deprecated and should not be used anymore. Also it does not return the attribute
  `msg` in all payloads as it was always empty.

- `xivo-confgend` has been renamed to `wazo-confgend`
  - The custom configuration files have been moved to `/etc/wazo-confgend/conf.d`
  - The log file has been renamed to `wazo-confgend.log`
  - The plugin entry points have been renamed from `xivo` to `wazo`. Plugins enabled in custom
    configuration files should use the new name.
  - The entry point identifier has been changed from `xivo_confgend` to `wazo_confgend`. If you have
    developed custom plugins for confgend you should use the new identifier in your `setup.py`.
- `xivo-confgend-client` has been renamed to `wazo-confgend-client`
  - If you used the `xivo-confgen` CLI tool you will now have to use `wazo-confgen`
- If you are upgrading a Wazo that was originally installed in 18.03 or earlier, the old directory
  configuration is now replaced with a new profile `default` for each tenant. The migration of the
  old directory configuration must be done manually, since there is no way to automatically detect
  the tenant for each directory configuration. To allow this migration, the old configuration is
  dumped in `/var/backups/xivo/dird_sources.yml` during the upgrade to Wazo Platform 19.14. The
  administrator must then recreate the directory configuration manually using the API or web
  interface.
- There is a [known bug](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/browse/WAZO-1254) that will remove
  pre-recorded sound files provided by the `xivo-sounds-*`, .e.g `xivo-sounds-fr-ca`. If you had
  installed one of these packages manually, you need to install the corresponding `wazo-sounds-*`
  package manually, e.g. `wazo-sounds-fr-ca`. Upgrades to Wazo >= 19.15 are not affected by this
  bug.

### 19.13 {#19-13}

- **Debian has been upgraded from version 9 (stretch) to 10 (buster).** Please consult the following
  detailed upgrade notes for more information:

- [Debian 10 (Buster) Upgrade Notes](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_notes_details/19-13/buster)

- `xivo-amid` has been renamed to `wazo-amid`
  - The custom configuration has been moved to `/etc/wazo-amid/conf.d/`.
  - The log file has been renamed to `wazo-amid.log`.
  - The NGINX proxy has been recreated in `/etc/nginx/locations/https-enabled/wazo-amid`.

Consult the
[19.13 Tickets](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D19.13)
for more information.

### 19.12 {#19-12}

#### General

- All administration interfaces `xivo-web-interface` and `wazo-admin-ui` have been removed. They are
  replaced by `wazo-ui`. To install it, run the following command after the upgrade:
  `apt install wazo-ui`.
- The Wazo Client and `xivo-ctid` have been removed.
- `wazo-dird` is now configured using its REST API. The previous configuration files have been
  removed and a new profile `default` is now created for each new tenant.
- Entity concept has been replaced by `Tenant`. The previous concept was not completely sealed and
  we have fixed it with the `tenant`.

  - Existing devices are migrated automatically to the tenant of their first associated line. If a
    device is in autoprov mode, it will be migrated to the default tenant. See
    [Introduction](/uc-doc/system/backup_restore#intro-provisioning) for more information on how
    device tenants are handled.
  - Agents are now multi-tenant. Agents created using the rest API that were not logged into a queue
    and that were not associated to a user have been deleted.
  - Skills are migrated to the tenant of the agent with whom they are associated. If a skill was not
    associated with an agent, it has been deleted.
  - All the existing skill rules have been associated to the tenant of the first queue found in the
    database. If there were no queue configured in the system, the skill rules have been deleted.
  - Call logs are now multi-tenant. Each call log that cannot be associated to a tenant has been
    associated to the `master` tenant. Also, for all call logs created after the upgrade, if the
    tenant cannot be extracted from call information, they will be associated to the master tenant.
  - [Migration of sound files to tenants](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_notes_details/19-03/sounds)
  - We needed to do some guesswork for ambiguous resources that shared other resources from
    different entities. These resources have been migrated to the most logical tenants. However, it
    may be possible that they are still associated to resources that were migrated to different
    tenants. When this happens, you need to fix them manually and to make sure to remove the
    affected resources or to recreate them in the right tenants. Even if they still work, these
    configurations are invalid and shall be removed automatically in future upgrades. Therefore, you
    should review the following resources:

    - call permissions
    - ivr
    - moh
    - pagings

- User authentication has been updated with the following changes:
  - User passwords cannot be returned in plain text anymore.
  - Users export (export CSV) cannot export passwords anymore.
  - Processing time to import users (import CSV) has been increased significantly if the field
    `password` is provided.
  - Fields `username` and `password` in `wazo-confd` API `/users` are now ignored for authentication
    and must be considered invalid. They have been replaced by `wazo-auth` API.
  - Field `enabled` for `wazo-confd` API `/users/<user_id>/cti` is now ignored for authentication
    and must be considered invalid. It has been replaced by `wazo-auth` API.
- Invalid user email address (e.g. `invalid@`) have been deleted automatically during upgrade.
- All agents will have to log out and log back in to receive calls from queues. You may use the
  command `wazo-agentd-cli -c "relog all"` to do this.
- The procedure for custom certificates, especially for Let's Encrypt certificates, has been
  simplified. See [Certificates for HTTPS](/uc-doc/system/https_certificate).
- People using the `xivo-aastra-2.6.0.2019` will have to upgrade to plugin version 1.9.2 or later
- `wazo-provd` now uses YAML configuration. The defaults can be overridden in the
  `/etc/wazo-provd/conf.d/` directory. See
  [Configuration Files](/uc-doc/system/configuration_files).
- The provisioning option `dhcp-integration` is now enabled by default. There is no REST API to
  disable this feature.
- Call pickups that have been created using the REST API or `wazo-admin-ui` have the interceptors
  and targets mixed up. Since call pickups created using the "orange" web-interface did not have
  that bug, we could not fix the existing configuration automatically. Faulty call pickups have to
  be edited and users moved from interceptors to targets and vice versa.
- Since the feature for managing certificates from the "orange" web-interface is gone, all
  certificates must now be managed manually. The directory to access to certificates is
  `/var/lib/xivo/certificates` and is not backuped or synchronized for HA anymore.
- If a group or queue was named `general`, then it has been renamed with one or more suffix `_`
  (e.g. `general_`). The name `general` is not allowed anymore.
- `xivo-sysconfd` is now asynchronous by default. This implies that changes made via the API or via
  a web interface may take some time to take effect after the action. If you rely on Asterisk being
  reloaded when configuring resources. See `sysconfd-configuration` to set the `synchronous` option
  to `true`.
- Upgrade from version older than 15.01 are not supported anymore.
- If a custom context (created using the REST API or wazo-admin-ui) was named with the following
  names, then it has been renamed with one or more suffix `_`. Also if the context name had invalid
  characters (i.e. space), then invalid characters are replaced by `_`. All custom configuration
  should be updated to reflect the changes.
  - `authentication`
  - `general`
  - `global`
  - `globals`
  - `parkedcalls`
  - `xivo-features`
  - `zonemessages`
- The `wazo-google` and `wazo-microsoft` plugins have been copied to the `wazo-auth` and `wazo-dird`
  repo. You **must** uninstall that plugin if you installed it manually from source to avoid
  conflicts between the supported version and the legacy version.

#### Asterisk related

- Asterisk version has been updated:
- [Asterisk 15 to 16 Upgrade Notes](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_notes_details/18-12/asterisk_16)
- Wazo now uses `res_pjsip` instead of `chan_sip`.
  - All custom lines with interface `SIP/something` must be changed to `PJSIP/something`
  - All custom dialplan using the `SIP_HEADER` dialplan function must be changed to `PJSIP_HEADER`
    function
  - The `SIPAddHeader` and `SIPRemoveHeader` dialplan application must be changed to `PJSIP_HEADER`
    function
- The username for all SIP devices in `autoprov` mode has been changed. Devices in `autoprov` mode
  will have to be restarted before entering the provisioning code.
- Asterisk configuration files can now be customized in the `/etc/asterisk/*.d/` directories. If you
  had custom configuration in `/etc/asterisk/*.conf` you will have to create a new file in the
  corresponding `*.d` directory to use your customized configuration. Files named `*.conf.dpkg-old`
  will be left in `/etc/asterisk` if this operation is required. See
  [Asterisk configuration files](/uc-doc/system/configuration_files#asterisk-configuration) for more
  details.
- The skill rules internal names have been changed to use the format `skillrule-<id>`. If you were
  using custom dialplan with a preprocessing subroutine to handle your skill rules, we recommend
  removing it and using the REST API (see
  [Apply Skill Rule Sets](/uc-doc/contact_center/skillbasedrouting#skill-apply)). If you really want
  to keep it, you must change the name used in the variable `XIVO_QUEUESKILLRULESET` to use the new
  format.
- Asterisk logs (`/var/log/asterisk/full`) now contain milliseconds
- The `tenant_name` variable has been removed from the call recording templates in favor of the
  `tenant_uuid`. If the `tenant_name` was used in the directory name, a symlink can be used to keep
  the same name.

#### Renaming

- The following services have been renamed:
  - `xivo-agentd` to `wazo-agentd`

  - Entrypoints for custom Python plugins have been renamed to `<new_service_name.*`.
  - Environment variable for `wazo-upgrade` has been renamed from `XIVO_CONFD_PORT` to
    `WAZO_CONFD_PORT`.
  - All users that are logged in Wazo, i.e. who have an authentication token, must logout and log
    back in, to apply the change of authorizations names (ACL).
- The following Python clients have been renamed. If you were using the old one in your Python code
  you should use the new one.
  - `xivo-agentd-client` to `wazo-agentd-client`
  - `xivo-confd-client` to `wazo-confd-client`
  - `xivo-dird-client` to `wazo-dird-client`

- The fail2ban jail was renamed from `asterisk-xivo` to `asterisk-wazo`.
- Chat messages, user and device presences are now handled by `wazo-chatd` instead of `wazo-calld`
  and `MongooseIM`.

  - All chat messages will be deleted after the upgrade.

- The `/var/lib/xivo/sounds` directory has been migrated to `/var/lib/wazo/sounds` and the directory
  `/var/lib/xivo` is considered deprecated. Please update all custom references to this path.

#### Developers

- The following daemons have been updated to Python 3. If you have written or installed a custom
  plugin for those daemons, you must ensure that the plugins are compatible with Python 3.
  - `wazo-auth`
  - `wazo-calld`
  - `wazo-confd`
  - `wazo-dird`
- The following backends in `wazo-auth` have been removed. All following users have been migrated to
  `wazo_user` backend.
  - `xivo_admin`
  - `xivo_service`
  - `xivo_user`
- `wazo-auth` API to implement a `wazo-auth` backend has been changed in 18.02. The compatibility
  code that allowed old backends to keep working has been removed.
  - The `get_ids` method has been removed.
- ACL templating has been modified: when generating multiple ACLs with one template, ACL were
  separated with `n`. They are now separated with `:` (colon). `n` is not interpreted anymore. You
  should hence replace any `n` with `:` in your ACLs.
- `wazo-provd` now uses `wazo-auth` to authenticate all requests and uses HTTPS. It is no longer
  possible to deactivate authentication. Therefore, all calls to the REST API will need to be made
  using HTTPS and a token generated with `wazo-auth`.
- `wazo-provd-cli` has been updated to remove the username and password command line arguments since
  they are no longer used.
- The configuration of `rest_api` section for `wazo-confd` configuration file has changed. See
  [wazo-confd changelog 19.06](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-confd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1906)
  for more information.
- All API related to `cti profile` have been removed. See
  [wazo-confd changelog 19.08](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-confd/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1908)
  for more information.
- Creating a resource using the REST API now requires the `Wazo-Tenant` HTTP header when the created
  resource is not in the same tenant as its creator.
- Authentication policies now have a `tenant_uuid` and the relationship between tenants and policies
  has been removed. If you did use policies with tenant association, the policy is now associated to
  one of its tenant. This feature is not used yet in Wazo, so most likely you are not affected.
- `wazo-confd` REST API does not allow to manage `call-logs` anymore.
- `wazo-provd` API URL has been updated to remove the `provd` prefix when present and add the API
  version number, which is `0.2`. All affected services and `wazo-provd-client` have been updated.
  Example: `/provd/dev_mgr` is now `/0.2/dev_mgr` and `/api/api.yml` is now `/0.2/api/api.yml`

## 2018

### 18.03 {#18-03}

- If you have a [custom certificate configured](/uc-doc/system/https_certificate), you will need to
  add a new symlink for wazo-upgrade:

  ```shell
  mkdir -p /etc/wazo-upgrade/conf.d
  ln -s "/etc/xivo/custom/custom-certificate.yml" "/etc/wazo-upgrade/conf.d/010-custom-certificate.yml"
  ```

- Default passwords for phones' web interfaces have been changed. You can change the password in
  `Configuration --> Provisioning --> Template device`.
- The default NAT option in General SIP settings has been automatically changed from
  `auto_force_rport` to `auto_force_rport,auto_comedia`. This makes NAT configuration easier but has
  no impact on environments without NAT.
  - In the rare cases where you want to keep `nat=auto_force_rport` you must explicitly change this
    value in the administation interface `Services --> IPBX --> General Settings --> SIP Protocol`
    in tab `Default`. See
    [Asterisk sip.conf sample](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/blob/15.1.1/configs/samples/sip.conf.sample#L869)
    for more information.
- The NAT configuration of every SIP line and SIP trunk has been automatically changed from
  `nat=auto_force_rport` to nothing, so that they inherit this setting from the General SIP
  settings.

### 18.02 {#18-02}

- For wazo-auth backend developers: The API to implement a wazo-auth backend has changed. Old
  implementations have to be updated. If the `BaseAuthenticationBackend` class was used as a base
  class for the backend the `get_metadata` method from the base class will use `get_ids` to generate
  the result of `get_metadata`.
  - The `get_ids` method has been removed.
  - The `get_metadata` method has been added.

### 18.01 {#18-01}

- **Debian has been upgraded from version 8 (jessie) to 9 (stretch).** Please consult the following
  detailed upgrade notes for more information:

- [Debian 9 (stretch) Upgrade Notes](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_notes_details/18-01/stretch)

- If you _did not_ setup a custom X.509 certificate for HTTPS (e.g. from Let's Encrypt), the
  certificate will be regenerated to include SubjectAltName fields. The two main reasons are Chrome
  compatibility and avoiding a lot of log warnings. This implies that you will have to add a new
  exception in your browser to access the Wazo web interface or services like
  [Unicom](https://phone.wazo.community).
- If you _did_ setup a custom X.509 certificate for HTTPS (e.g. from Let's Encrypt), you will have
  to add a link to the wazo-auth-cli configuration using the following command.

  ```shell
  ln -s "/etc/xivo/custom/custom-certificate.yml" "/etc/wazo-auth-cli/conf.d/010-custom-certificate.yml"
  ```

- The Python API for xivo-confd plugins has been updated to reflect Python API of other daemons. If
  you have created a custom xivo-confd plugin, you must update it:

  ```Python
  class Plugin(object):

     def load(self, core):
         api = core.api
         config = core.config
  ```

  ```Python
  class Plugin(object):

     def load(self, dependencies):
         api = dependencies['api']
         config = dependencies['config']
  ```

- The web interface no longer validates the queue skill rules fields added in
  `Services --> Call Center --> Configuration --> Skill rules`. If a rule is wrong, it will appear
  in the Asterisk console.
