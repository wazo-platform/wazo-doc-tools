## What is the point?

Sometimes, you may need to upgrade your Wazo to a specific version, in case you don't want to
upgrade to the latest (which is not recommended, but sometimes necessary).

## Prerequisites

**Note**: These procedures are _complementary_ to the upgrade procedure listed in
[version specific upgrade](/uc-doc/upgrade#version-specific-upgrade). You must follow the
version-specific procedure _before_ running the following procedures.

- [Upgrade from Wazo \< 19.04](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_specific_version/archives-from-wazo-stretch)
- [Upgrade from Wazo \> 19.12](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_specific_version/archives-from-wazo-buster)
- [Upgrade from Wazo \> 23.05](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_specific_version/archives-from-wazo-bullseye)
