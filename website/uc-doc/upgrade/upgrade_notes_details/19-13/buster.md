title: Debian 10 (Buster) Upgrade Notes
---

The upgrade to Wazo 19.13 or later will take longer than usual, because the whole Debian system will
be upgraded.

The database management system (postgresql) will also be upgraded from version 9.6 to version 11 at
the same time. This will upgrade the database used by Wazo. This operation should take at most a few
minutes.

After the upgrade, the system will need to be rebooted.

## Before the upgrade

- Make sure your version of Wazo is at least 18.01. You can run `wazo-upgrade` to check the version
  currently installed. If your version of Wazo is older that 18.01, you should first upgrade your
  Wazo to Debian Stretch, following the procedure described in
  [Debian 9 (stretch) Upgrade Notes](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_notes_details/18-01/stretch).
- Make sure your have sufficient space for the upgrade. You might run into trouble if you have less
  than 2 GiB available in the file system that holds the `/var` and `/` directories.
- Remove the `freeradius` package. If you have recompiled Asterisk on you server you most likely
  installed the `libfreeradius-dev` package, which pulled `freeradius`. This package cannot be
  configured on Debian Buster under some circumstances that are not under our control. You can
  remove it with the following command `apt purge freeradius`
- If you have customized the Debian system of your Wazo in some nontrivial way, you might want to
  review the [official Debian release notes](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/releasenotes)
  before the upgrade. Most importantly, you should:
  - Make sure you don\'t have any unofficial sources in your `/etc/apt/sources.list` or
    `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` directory. If you were using the `stretch-backports` source, you must
    remove it.
  - Remove packages that were automatically installed and are not needed anymore, by running
    `apt-get autoremove --purge`.
  - Purge removed packages. You can see the list of packages in this state by running
    `dpkg -l | awk '/^rc/ { print $2 }'` and purge all of them with
    `apt-get purge $(dpkg -l | awk '/^rc/ { print $2 }')`
  - Remove `.dpkg-old`, `.dpkg-dist` and `.dpkg-new` files from previous upgrade. You can see a list
    of these files by running
    `find /etc -name '*.dpkg-old' -o -name '*.dpkg-dist' -o -name '*.dpkg-new'`.

## Upgrade

The upgrade must be done with three commands:

- `wazo-dist -m pelican-stretch`: Ensures your system is not restricted to a specific version
- `wazo-upgrade`: Installs the `wazo-dist-upgrade` script and makes sure the system is up-to-date.
- `wazo-dist-upgrade`: Upgrades to the latest version of Wazo with Debian 10 (Buster). This upgrade
  will take longer than usual.

You may need to reboot your machine before running `wazo-dist-upgrade`. `wazo-dist-upgrade` will
tell you if a reboot is needed.

To minimize the downtime, you can pre-download the packages required for the upgrade with:

```shell
wazo-upgrade -d
wazo-dist-upgrade -d
```

## After the upgrade

- Check that customization to your configuration files is still effective.

  During the upgrade, new version of configuration files are going to be installed, and these might
  override your local customization. For example, the vim package provides a new `/etc/vim/vimrc`
  file. If you have customized this file, after the upgrade you\'ll have both a `/etc/vim/vimrc` and
  `/etc/vim/vimrc.dpkg-old` file, the former containing the new version of the file shipped by the
  vim package while the latter is your customized version. You should merge your customizations back
  into the new file, then delete the `.dpkg-old` file.

  You can see a list of affected files by running `find /etc -name '*.dpkg-old'`. If some files show
  up that you didn't modify yourself, you can ignore them.

- Purge removed packages. You can see the list of packages in this state by running
  `dpkg -l | awk '/^rc/ { print $2 }'` and purge all of them with
  `apt-get purge $(dpkg -l | awk '/^rc/ { print $2 }')`
- Reboot your system. It is necessary for the new Linux kernel to be effective.
