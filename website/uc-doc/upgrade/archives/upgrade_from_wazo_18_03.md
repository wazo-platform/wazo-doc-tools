title: Upgrading from Wazo 18.03
---

## Rationale

Wazo 18.03 was the last version before a big gap in Wazo versions: the next available version is
Wazo 19.12. As a consequence, a lot of Wazo installation have been installed in this version. Given
the big gap of versions, there are some corner cases that are not handled automatically by
`wazo-upgrade`.

## Procedure

- Read the [upgrade notes](/uc-doc/upgrade/upgrade_notes#19-12): features have been removed after
  Wazo 18.03.

- Check the system locale

  - Execute `locale -a`
  - If the system locale is not `en.UTF-8`, change it to `en.UTF-8` and reboot.

- Check there is no custom certificate configured in `/etc/xivo/custom/custom-certificate.yml`.

  - If there is a custom certificate configured, follow
    [this procedure](https://wazo-platform.org/uc-doc/system/https_certificate#revert-previous-custom-https-certificate-configuration)
    to remove the custom certificate configuration.

- Check that `wazo-auth-cli` is working properly (a backup/restore may have
  [broken this tool](/etc/xivo/custom/custom-certificate.yml))

  - `wazo-auth-cli --config /root/.config/wazo-auth-cli user list` should return a list of system
    users.
  - If it returns an error
    `401 Client Error: UNAUTHORIZED for url: https://localhost:9497/0.1/token`, follow the
    workaround procedure in [this ticket](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/browse/WAZO-1413).

- Run `wazo-upgrade`

- Check that the database configuration is not skipped

  - Execute `debconf-show xivo-manage-db`
  - Check that `xivo-manage-db/db-skip` is set to `false`
  - If set to `true`, then probably an upgrade script has failed. Check `/var/log/xivo-upgrade.log`
    to determine the cause of the problem.
  - Once you have found the problem, run `wazo-upgrade -f` again to execute the missing upgrade
    scripts
  - Execute `debconf-show xivo-manage-db` to check again
  - Check that `xivo-manage-db/db-skip` is set to `false`
  - In last recourse, run: `echo PURGE | debconf-communicate xivo-manage-db`

- Run `wazo-dist-upgrade`
