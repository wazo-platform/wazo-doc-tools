The platform released as a [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). Most of its distinctive components, and Wazo Platform as a whole, are distributed under the _GPLv3 license_.

## Wazo History

Wazo is a fork of XiVO, which was created in 2005 in France by Sylvain Boily and the company
Proformatique. In 2010, Proformatique merged with Avencall, and Avencall acquired the copyright and
trademark of XiVO.

Sylvain then moved to Quebec City and founded Proformatique, Inc. where the XiVO core development
team worked from 2011 until November 2016.

In November 2016, Proformatique Inc. was shut down and the development team
[forked XiVO to create Wazo](/blog/introducing-wazo). Its first release, Wazo 16.16, was released in
December 2016.
