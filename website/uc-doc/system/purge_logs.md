title: wazo-purge-db
---

Keeping records of personal communications for long periods may be subject to local legislation, to
avoid personal data retention. Also, keeping too many records may become resource intensive for the
server. To ease the removal of such records, `wazo-purge-db` is a process that removes old log
entries from the database. This allows keeping records for a maximum period and deleting older ones.

By default, wazo-purge-db removes all logs older than a year (365 days), except for webhookd logs
where only 30 days are kept. wazo-purge-db is run nightly.

**Note**: Please check the laws applicable to your country and modify `days_to_keep` (see below) in
the configuration file accordingly.

## Records Purged

The following features are impacted by wazo-purge-db:

- [Call Logs](/uc-doc/administration/call_logs)
- Call center statistics

More technically, `wazo-purge-db` have a set of plugins, each plugin are responsible of certain type
of record (usually a postgresql table).

The format of the following list is `plugin-name` (`associated table`) :

- `call-logs` (`call_logd_call_log`, `call_logd_recordings` and recording files)
- `cel` (`cel`)
- `queue-log` (`queue_log`)
- `recordings` (`call_logd_recordings` and recording files)
- `stat-agent` (`stat_agent_periodic`)
- `stat-call` (`stat_call_on_queue`)
- `stat-queue` (`stat_queue_periodic`)
- `stat-switchboard` (`stat_switchboard_queue`)
- `webhookd-logs` (`webhookd_subscription_log`)

## Configuration File {#purge-logs-config-file}

We recommend to override the setting `days_to_keep` from `/etc/wazo-purge-db/config.yml` in a new
file in `/etc/wazo-purge-db/conf.d/`.

The `days_to_keep` configuration can be done per plugin if needed, by setting
`days_to_keep_per_plugin` for example:

```yaml
days_to_keep_per_plugin:
  webhookd-logs: 30
```

**Warning**: Setting `days_to_keep` to 0 will NOT disable `wazo-purge-db`, and will remove ALL logs
from your system.

See [Configuration priority](/uc-doc/system/configuration_files#configuration-priority) and
`/etc/wazo-purge-db/config.yml` for more details.

## Manual Purge

It is possible to purge logs manually. To do so, log on to the target Wazo server and run:

```shell
wazo-purge-db
```

You can specify the number of days of logs to keep. For example, to purge entries older than 365
days:

```shell
wazo-purge-db -d 365
```

Usage of `wazo-purge-db`:

```text
usage: wazo-purge-db [-h] [-d DAYS_TO_KEEP]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DAYS_TO_KEEP, --days_to_keep DAYS_TO_KEEP
                        Number of days data will be kept in tables
```

## Maintenance

After an execution of `wazo-purge-db`, postgresql's
[Autovacuum Daemon](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/static/routine-vacuuming.html#AUTOVACUUM)
should perform a [VACUUM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/static/sql-vacuum.html) ANALYZE
automatically (after 1 minute). This command marks memory as reusable but does not actually free
disk space, which is fine if your disk is not getting full. In the case when `wazo-purge-db` hasn't
run for a long time (e.g. when [`days_to_keep`](/uc-doc/system/purge_logs#purge-logs-config-file) is
decreased), some administrator may want to perform a
[VACUUM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/static/sql-vacuum.html) FULL to recover disk space.

**Warning**: VACUUM FULL will require a service interruption. This may take several hours depending
on the size of purged database.

You need to:

```shell
wazo-service stop
sudo -u postgres psql asterisk -c "VACUUM (FULL)"
wazo-service start
```

## Archive Plugins

In the case you want to keep archives of the logs removed by wazo-purge-db, you may install plugins
to wazo-purge-db that will be run before the purge.

Wazo does not provide any archive plugin. You will need to develop plugins for your own need. If you
want to share your plugins, please open a
[pull request](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-purge-db/pulls).

## Archive Plugins (for Developers)

Each plugin is a Python callable (function or class constructor), that takes a dictionary of
configuration as argument. The keys of this dictionary are the keys taken from the configuration
file. This allows you to add plugin-specific configuration in `/etc/wazo-purge-db/conf.d/`.

There is an example plugin in the
[wazo-purge-db git repo](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-purge-db/tree/master/contribs).

### Example

Archive name: sample

Purpose: demonstrate how to create your own archive plugin.

#### Activate Plugin

Each plugin needs to be explicitly enabled in the configuration of `wazo-purge-db`. Here is an
example of file added in `/etc/wazo-purge-db/conf.d/`:

```yaml
enabled_plugins:
  archives:
    - sample
```

#### sample.py

The following example will be save a file in `/tmp/wazo_purge_db.sample` with the following content:

```text
Save tables before purge. 365 days to keep!
```

```python
sample_file = '/tmp/wazo_purge_db.sample'

def sample_plugin(config):
    with open(sample_file, 'w') as output:
        output.write('Save tables before purge. {0} days to keep!'.format(config['days_to_keep']))
```

#### Install sample plugin

The following `setup.py` shows an example of a python library that adds a plugin to wazo-purge-db:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from setuptools import setup
from setuptools import find_packages


setup(
    name='wazo-purge-db-sample-plugin',
    version='0.0.1',

    description='An example program',
    packages=find_packages(),
    entry_points={
        'wazo_purge_db.archives': [
            'sample = wazo_purge_db_sample.sample:sample_plugin',
        ],
    }
)
```
