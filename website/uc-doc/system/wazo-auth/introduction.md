title: Introduction

wazo-auth is a scalable, extendable and configurable authentication service. It uses an HTTP
interface to emit tokens to users who can then use those tokens to identify and authenticate
themselves with other services compatible with wazo-auth.

The HTTP API reference is at [documentation](https://wazo-platform.org/documentation).

## Usage

wazo-auth is used through HTTP requests, using HTTPS. As a user, the most common operation is to get
a new token. This is done with the POST method.

Alice retrieves a token using her username/password:

```shell
# Alice creates a new token, using the wazo_user backend, expiring in 10 minutes
curl -k -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u 'alice:s3cre7' "https://localhost/api/auth/0.1/token" -d '{"backend": "wazo_user", "expiration": 600}';echo
{"data": {"issued_at": "2015-06-05T10:16:58.557553", "utc_issued_at": "2015-06-05T15:16:58.557553", "token": "1823c1ee-6c6a-0cdc-d869-964a7f08a744", "auth_id": "63f3dc3c-865d-419e-bec2-e18c4b118224", "xivo_user_uuid": "63f3dc3c-865d-419e-bec2-e18c4b118224", "expires_at": "2015-06-05T11:16:58.557595", "utc_expires_at": "2015-06-05T16:16:58.557595"}}
```

In this example Alice used here login `alice` and password `s3cre7`. The authentication source is
determined by the [backend](/uc-doc/system/wazo-auth/stock_plugins) in the POST data.

Alice could also have specified an expiration time on her POST request. The expiration value is the
number of seconds before the token expires.

After retrieving her token, Alice can query other services that use wazo-auth and send her token to
those service. Those services can then use this token on Alice's behalf to access her personal
storage.

If Alice wants to revoke her token before its expiration:

```shell
curl -k -X DELETE -H 'Content-Type: application/json' "https://localhost/api/auth/0.1/token/1823c1ee-6c6a-0cdc-d869-964a7f08a744"
```

See [documentation](https://wazo-platform.org/documentation) for more details about the HTTP API.

See [Service Authentication](/uc-doc/system/service_authentication) for details about the
authentication process.

## Usage for services using wazo-auth

A service that requires authentication and identification can use wazo-auth to externalise the
burden of authentication. The new service can then accept a token as part of its operations to
authenticate the user using the service.

Once a service receives a token from one of its user, it will need to check the validity of that
token. There are 2 forms of verification, one that only checks if the token is valid and the other
returns information about this token's session if it is valid.

Checking if a token is valid:

```shell
curl -k -i -X HEAD -H 'Content-Type: application/json' "https://localhost/api/auth/0.1/token/1823c1ee-6c6a-0cdc-d869-964a7f08a744"

# get more information about this token
curl -k -X GET -H 'Content-Type: application/json' "https://localhost/api/auth/0.1/token/1823c1ee-6c6a-0cdc-d869-964a7f08a744";echo
{"data": {"issued_at": "2015-06-05T10:16:58.557553", "utc_issued_at": "2015-06-05T15:16:58.557553", "token": "1823c1ee-6c6a-0cdc-d869-964a7f08a744", "auth_id": "63f3dc3c-865d-419e-bec2-e18c4b118224", "xivo_user_uuid": "63f3dc3c-865d-419e-bec2-e18c4b118224", "expires_at": "2015-06-05T11:16:58.557595", "utc_expires_at": "2015-06-05T16:16:58.557595"}}
```

## Launching wazo-auth

```ascii
usage: wazo-auth [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-u USER] [-d] [-f] [-l LOG_LEVEL]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        The path to the config file
  -u USER, --user USER  User to run the daemon
  -d, --debug           Log debug messages
  -l LOG_LEVEL, --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        Logs messages with LOG_LEVEL details. Must be one of:
                        critical, error, warning, info, debug. Default: None
```

## Configuration

## Policies

A policy is a list of access that is used to access Wazo resources. Policies can be created, deleted
or modified using the REST API.
