## Architecture

wazo-auth contains 3 major components, an HTTP interface, authentication backends and a storage
module. All operations are made through the HTTP interface, tokens are stored in postgres as well as
the persistence for some of the data attached to tokens. Backends are used to test if a supplied
username/password combination is valid and provide the xivo-user-uuid.

wazo-auth is made of the following modules and packages.

### backend_plugins

the plugin package contains the wazo-auth backends that are packaged with wazo-auth.

### http_plugins

The http module is the implementation of the HTTP interface.

- Validate parameters
- Calls the backend the check the user authentication
- Forward instructions to the _token_manager_
- Handle exceptions and return the appropriate status_code

### controller

The controller is the plumbin of wazo-auth, it has no business logic.

- Start the HTTP application
- Load all enabled plugins
- Instantiate the token_manager

### token

The token modules contains the business logic of wazo-auth.

- Creates and delete tokens
- Creates ACL for Wazo
- Schedule token expiration

## Plugins {#developing-plugins}

wazo-auth is meant to be easy to extend. This section describes how to add features to wazo-auth.

### Backends

wazo-auth allows its administrator to configure one or many sources of authentication. Implementing
a new kind of authentication is quite simple.

1. Create a python module implementing the
   [backend interface](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-auth/blob/master/wazo_auth/interfaces.py).
2. Install the python module with an entry point `wazo_auth.backends`

An example backend implementation is available
[here](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-auth-example-backend).

### External Auth

wazo-auth allows the user to enable arbitrary external authentication, store sensible information
which can be retrieved later given an appropriate ACL.

An external authentication plugin is made of the following parts.

1. A setup.py adding the plugin the `wazo_auth.http` entry point
2. A flask_restful class implementing the route for this plugin
3. A marshmallow model that can filter the stored data to be safe for unprivileged view
4. A plugin_info dictionary with information that should be displayed in UI concerning this plugin

The restful class should do the following:

- POST: This is where the plugin should setup any information with the external service and usually
  return a validation code and a validation URL to the user.
- GET: After activating the external authentication, following the POST. The GET can be used to
  retrieve credentials granting access to certain resource of the external service.
- DELETE: Should remove the stored data from wazo-auth
- PUT: (optional) Could be implemented to modify the scope of the generated credentials if the
  external service allow that kind of modification.

#### OAuth2 helpers

If the external service uses OAuth2 it is possible to use some helper functions in the external_auth
service.

Those helpers can be used to get notified when the user has accepted wazo-auth on the external
service.

The following helpers are available:

```python
external_auth_service.register_oauth2_callback(auth_type, user_uuid, state, callback, *args, **kwargs)
```

- auth_type: The name of the authentication backend
- user_uuid: The user UUID of the user creating the external auth
- state: The state returned from the authorization URL query
- callback: the callable that should be triggered when the authorization is complete
- args and kwargs: arguments that will be added to the callback arguments

When the callback function gets called, its last args will be the message sent to the redirect URL
by the external service.

**Note**: The callback is not executed in the main thread. You should take care of thread
synchronization when sharing data structures between threads.

The callback is usually used to create a first token on the external service.

```python
external_auth_service.build_oauth2_redirect_url(auth_type)
```

This helper returns a URL that can be used by the OAuth2Session to trigger a redirection and
receives a callback when the authorization is complete.

#### Example

```text
setup.py
src/plugin.py
```

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from setuptools import find_packages
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name='auth_bar',
    version='0.1',

    packages=find_packages(),
    entry_points={
        'wazo_auth.external_auth': [
            'bar = src.plugin:BarPlugin',
        ],
    }
)
```

```python
from marshmallow import Schema, fields, pre_load
from flask import request
from wazo_auth import http


class BarService(http.AuthResource):

    auth_type = 'bar'  # Should be the same as the entry point

        return '', 204

    @http.required_acl('auth.users.{user_uuid}.external.bar.read')
    def get(self, user_uuid):
        # The GET retrieves all stored data from the service and return the secret that is
        # required to use the Bar service

        # The GET will also need to generate a new token if the current one has expired.
        return self.external_auth_service.get(user_uuid, self.auth_type), 200

    @http.required_acl('auth.users.{user_uuid}.external.bar.create')
    def post(self, user_uuid):
        session = OAuth2Session(self.client_id, scope=self.scope, redirect_uri=self.redirect_uri)
        # Should use the body of the POST and create a token with the Bar service
        data = request.get_json(force=True)
        authorization_url, state = session.authorization_url(
            self.authorization_base_url,
            access_type='offline',
        )
        self.external_auth_service.register_oauth2_callback(
            state,
            self.create_first_token,
            session,
            user_uuid,
       )

       return {'authorization_url': authorization_url}, 201

   def create_first_token(self, session, user_uuid, msg):
       # This callback is triggered when the user authorize wazo-auth using the authorization_url
       token_data = session.fetch_token(
           self.token_url,
           client_secret=self.client_secret['us'],
           code=msg['code'],
       )

       data = {

           'refresh_token': token_data.get('refresh_token'),
           'token_expiration': get_timestamp_expiration(token_data['expires_in'])
       }

       self.external_auth_service.update(user_uuid, self.auth_type, data)


# When GET /users/:uuid/external is called this model will be used to filter the private data
class BarSafeData(Schema):

    # Only the scope field will be returned
    scope = fields.List(fields.String)

        api = dependencies['api']
        external_auth_service = dependencies['external_auth_service']
        args = (external_auth_service,)

        # If the plugin does not register a safe mode an empty dictionary will be used when doing
        # a GET /users/:uuid/external
        external_auth_service.register_safe_auth_model('bar', BarSafeData)
