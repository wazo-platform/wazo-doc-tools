title: Log Files
---

Every Wazo service has its own log file, placed in `/var/log`.

## asterisk

The Asterisk log files are managed by logrotate.

It's configuration files `/etc/logrotate.d/asterisk` and `/etc/asterisk/logger.conf`

The message log level is enabled by default in `logger.conf` and contains notices, warnings and
errors. The full log entry is commented in `logger.conf` and should only be enabled when verbose
debugging is required. Using this option in production would produce VERY large log files.
