The wazo-dird architecture uses plugins as extension points for most of its job. It uses
[stevedore](https://docs.openstack.org/developer/stevedore/) to do the plugin instantiation and
discovery and [ABC](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/abc.html) classes to define the required
interface.

Plugins in wazo-dird use setuptools' entry points. That means that installing a new plugin to
wazo-dird requires an entry point in the plugin's setup.py. Each entry point's namespace is
documented in the appropriate documentation section. These entry points allow wazo-dird to be able
to discover and load extensions packaged with wazo-dird or installed separately.

Each kind of plugin does a specific job. There are three kinds of plugins in wazo-dird.

1. [Back-End](/uc-doc/system/wazo-dird/developer#dird-back-end)
2. [Service](/uc-doc/system/wazo-dird/developer#dird-service)
3. [View](/uc-doc/system/wazo-dird/developer#dird-view)

![wazo-dird HTTP query](/images/uc-doc/system/wazo-dird/query.png)

All plugins are instantiated by the core. The core then keeps a catalogue of loaded extensions that
can be supplied to other extensions.

The following setup.py shows an example of a python library that add a plugin of each kind to
wazo-dird:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from setuptools import setup
from setuptools import find_packages


setup(
    name='Wazo dird plugin sample',
    version='0.0.1',

    description='An example program',

    packages=find_packages(),

    entry_points={
        'wazo_dird.services': [
            'my_service = dummy:DummyServicePlugin',
        ],
        'wazo_dird.backends': [
            'my_backend = dummy:DummyBackend',
        ],
        'wazo_dird.views': [
            'my_view = dummy:DummyView',
        ],
    }
)
```

## Back-End {#dird-back-end}

Back-ends are used to query directories. Each back-end implements a way to query a given directory.
Each instance of a given back-end is called a source. Sources are used by the services to get
results from each configured directory.

Given one LDAP back-end, I can configure a source from the LDAP at alpha.example.com and another
source from the other LDAP at beta.example.com. Both of these sources use the LDAP back-end.

### Implementation details

- Namespace: `wazo_dird.backends`
- Abstract source plugin:
  [BaseSourcePlugin](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-dird/blob/master/wazo_dird/plugins/base_plugins.py#L67)
- Methods:
  - `name`: the name of the source, typically retrieved from the configuration injected to `load()`
  - `load(args)`: set up resources used by the plugin, depending on the config. `args` is a
    dictionary containing:
    - key `config`: the source configuration for this instance of the back-end
    - key `main_config`: the whole configuration of wazo-dird
  - `unload()`: free resources used by the plugin.
  - `search(term, args)`: The search method returns a list of dictionary.
    - Empty values should be `None`, instead of empty string.
    - `args` is a dictionary containing:
      - key `token_infos`: data associated to the authentication token (see
        [wazo-auth](/uc-doc/system/configuration_files#wazo-auth))
  - `first_match(term, args)`: The first_match method returns a dictionary.
    - Empty values should be `None`, instead of empty string.
    - `args` is a dictionary containing:
      - key `token_infos`: data associated to the authentication token (see
        [wazo-auth](/uc-doc/system/configuration_files#wazo-auth))
  - `match_all(terms, args)`: The match_all method returns a dictionary.
    - Empty values should be `{}`.
    - `args` is a dictionary containing:
      - key `token_infos`: data associated to the authentication token (see
        [wazo-auth](/uc-doc/system/configuration_files#wazo-auth))
  - `list(uids, args)`: The list method returns a list of dictionary from a list of uids. Each uid
    is a string identifying a contact within the source.
    - `args` is a dictionary containing:
      - key `token_infos`: data associated to the authentication token (see
        [wazo-auth](/uc-doc/system/configuration_files#wazo-auth))

The implementation of the back-end should take these values into account and return results
accordingly.

### Example

The following example add a backend that will return random names and number.

`dummy.py`:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class DummyBackendPlugin(object):

    def name(self):
        return 'my_local_dummy'

    def load(self, args):
        logger.info('dummy backend loaded')

    def unload(self):
        logger.info('dummy backend unloaded')

    def search(self, term, args):
        nb_results = random.randint(1, 20)
        return _random_list(nb_results)

    def list(self, unique_ids):
        return _random_list(len(unique_ids))

    def _random_list(self, nb_results):
        columns = ['Firstname', 'Lastname', 'Number']
        return [_random_entry(columns) for _ in xrange(nb_results)]

    def _random_entry(self, columns):
        random_stuff = [_random_string() for _ in xrange(len(columns))]
        return dict(zip(columns, random_stuff))

    def _random_string(self):
        return ''.join(random.choice(string.lowercase) for _ in xrange(5))
```

## Service {#dird-service}

Service plugins add new functionality to the dird server. These functionalities are available to
views. When loaded, a service plugin receives its configuration and a dictionary of available
sources.

Some service examples that come to mind include:

- A lookup service to search through all configured sources.
- A reverse lookup service to search through all configured sources and return a specific field of
  the first matching result.

### Implementation details

- Namespace: `wazo_dird.services`
- Abstract service plugin:
  [BaseServicePlugin](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-dird/blob/master/wazo_dird/plugins/base_plugins.py#L21)
- Methods:

  - `load(args)`: set up resources used by the plugin, depending on the config. `args` is a
    dictionary containing:

    - key `config`: the whole configuration file in dict form
    - key `sources`: a dictionary of source names to sources

    `load` must return the service object, which is any kind of python object.

  - `unload()`: free resources used by the plugin.

### Example

The following example adds a service that will return an empty list when used.

`dummy.py`:

```python
import logging

from wazo_dird import BaseServicePlugin

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class DummyServicePlugin(BaseServicePlugin):
    """
    This plugin is responsible fow instantiating and returning the
    DummyService. It manages its life time and should take care of
    its cleanup if necessary
    """

    def load(self, args):
        """
        Ignores all provided arguments and instantiate a DummyService that
        is returned to the core
        """
        logger.info('dummy loaded')
        self._service = DummyService()
        return self._service

    def unload(self):
        logger.info('dummy unloaded')


class DummyService(object):
    """
    A very dumb service that will return an empty list every time it is used
    """

    def list(self):
        """
        This function must be called explicitly from the view, `list` is not a
        special method name for wazo-dird
        """
        return []
```

## View {#dird-view}

View plugins add new routes to the HTTP application in wazo-dird, in particular the REST API of
wazo-dird: they define the URLs to which wazo-dird will respond and the formatting of data received
and sent through those URLs.

For example, we can define a REST API formatted in JSON with one view and the same API formatted in
XML with another view. Supporting the directory function of a phone is generally a matter of adding
a new view for the format that the phone consumes.

### Implementation details

- Namespace: `wazo_dird.views`
- Abstract view plugin:
  [BaseViewPlugin](https://github.com/wazo-platform/wazo-dird/blob/master/wazo_dird/plugins/base_plugins.py#L52)
- Methods:
  - `load(args)`: set up resources used by the plugin, depending on the config. Typically, register
    routes on Flask. Those routes would typically call a service. `args` is a dictionary containing:
    - key `config`: the section of the configuration file for all views in dict form
    - key `services`: a dictionary of services, indexed by name, which may be called from a route
    - key `http_app`: the `Flask application` instance
    - key `rest_api`: a `Flask-RestFul Api` instance
  - `unload()`: free resources used by the plugin.

### Example

The following example adds a simple view: `GET /0.1/directories/ping` answers `{"message": "pong"}`.

`dummy.py`:

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import logging

from flask_restful import Resource

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)


class PingViewPlugin(object):

    name = 'ping'

    def __init__(self):
        logger.debug('dummy view created')

    def load(self, args):
        logger.debug('dummy view args: %s', args)

        args['rest_api'].add_resource(PingView, '/0.1/directories/ping')

    def unload(self):
        logger.debug('dummy view unloaded')


class PingView(Resource):
    """
    Simple API using Flask-Restful: GET /0.1/directories/ping answers "pong"
    """

    def get(self):
        return {'message': 'pong'}
```
