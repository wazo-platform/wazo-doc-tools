  - [request_handlers section](#request-handlers-section)

wazo-sysconfd is the system configuration server for Wazo. It does quite a few different things;
here's a non exhaustive list:

- configuring network (hostname, DNS)
- configuring high availability
- staring/stopping/restarting services
- reloading asterisk configuration
- sending some events to components (wazo-agentd)

## Configuration File {#sysconfd-configuration}

Default location: `/etc/xivo/sysconfd.conf`. Format: `INI`.

The default location may be overwritten by the command line options.

Here's an example of the configuration file:

```ini
[general]
xivo_config_path = /etc/xivo
templates_path = /usr/share/wazo-sysconfd/templates
custom_templates_path = /etc/xivo/sysconfd/custom-templates
backup_path = /var/backups/wazo-sysconfd

[resolvconf]
hostname_file = /etc/hostname
hostname_update_cmd = /etc/init.d/hostname.sh start
hosts_file = /etc/hosts
resolvconf_file = /etc/resolv.conf

[wizard]
templates_path = /usr/share/xivo-config/templates
custom_templates_path = /etc/xivo/custom-templates

[commonconf]
commonconf_file = /etc/xivo/common.conf
commonconf_cmd = /usr/sbin/xivo-update-config
commonconf_monit = /usr/sbin/wazo-monitoring-update

[monit]
monit_checks_dir = /usr/share/wazo-monitoring/checks
monit_conf_dir = /etc/monit/conf.d

[request_handlers]
synchronous = false

[bus]
username = guest
password = guest
host = localhost
port = 5672
exchange_name = xivo
exchange_type = topic
exchange_durable = true
```

### request_handlers section {#request-handlers-section}

- `synchronous`:

  - `true`: when wazo-sysconfd receives a request to reload the dialplan for example, it will wait
    for the dialplan reload to complete before replying to the request.
  - `false`: wazo-sysconfd reply to the request immediately.

  Setting this option to `false` will speed up some operation (for example, editing a user from
  wazo-confd), but this means that there will be a small delay (up to a few seconds in the worst
  case) between the time you create your user and the time you can dial successfully its extension.
