wazo-phoned is an interface to use directory service with phones. It offers a simple REST interface
to authenticate phones and to search results from [wazo-dird](/uc-doc/system/log_files#wazo-dird).

## Usage

wazo-phoned is used through HTTP requests, using HTTP and HTTPS. Its default port is 9498 and 9499.
As a user, the common operation is to search through directory from a phone. The phone needs to send
two parameters:

- `xivo_user_uuid`: The Wazo user uuid that the phone is associated. It's used to search through
  personal contacts (see [personal](/uc-doc/system/wazo-dird/stock_plugins#dird-services-personal)).
- `profile`: The profile that the user is associated. It's used to format results as configured.

**Note**: Since most phones don't support HTTPS, a small protection is to configure
`/access_features` from wazo-confd REST API.

## Launching wazo-phoned

On the command line, type `wazo-phoned -h` to see how to use it.
