Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 24.16 release.

## New Features in This Release
**caller ID**: user-selectable caller id now makes use of the new `phone-numbers` wazo-confd API resource to provide `shared` and `main` caller id types exposed through wazo-confd API `/users/{user_uuid}/callerids/outgoing`

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the [changelog](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D24.16).

See you at the next sprint review!
