Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 23.15 release.

## New Features in This Release

- **Directories**: Directory lookups can now match Wazo users in the internal directory when searching using a full name. Ex: "Alice Smith" would match the corresponding user.

## Technical

- **User API**: Listing users is now faster when using pagination on a large user base.
- **Directories**: Reverse lookup will now happen whenever the caller ID name looks like a phone number, instead of only happening when the name and number are the same.
- **Asterisk**: Asterisk has been upgraded to 20.5.0. [See the Asterisk release announcement](https://www.asterisk.org/asterisk-news/asterisk-20-5-0-now-available/).

## Ongoing Features

- **Scalability**: Under the hood changes to make Wazo more performant on large installations.
