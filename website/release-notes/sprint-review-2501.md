Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 25.01 release.

This sprint, we focused mainly on technical tasks, tackling key improvements and ensuring smooth
progress on ongoing projects. Alongside this, we also took some time to recharge and spend quality
moments with our friends and families during Holidays. After this restful break, we're recharged and
ready to start the new year off on the right foot!

Happy New Year!
