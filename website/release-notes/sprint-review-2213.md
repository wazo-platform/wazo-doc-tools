Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 22.13 release.

## New Features in This Release

- **Call filters**: When calling a filtered extension, the filtering user will ring on all lines, rather than only one line.
- **Configuration API**: A new API has been added easily create an extension and attach it to a line at the same time

## Ongoing Features

- **New user API**: We are working on a new high level API endpoint to create a user and all of its related resources (user, line, extension, voicemail, incoming call) in a single HTTP request.
- **Events**: All events are being documented in order to better facilitate developers effort to use the event system.
- **Major upgrade**: We are preparing the upgrade to Debian 11 Bullseye. This requires migrating the remaining code written in Python 2 to Python 3.
