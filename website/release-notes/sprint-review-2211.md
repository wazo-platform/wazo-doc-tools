Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 22.11 release.

## Technical Features

- **sysconfd**: The system configuration service has been rewritten to remove unmaintained part of
  code

## Ongoing Features

- **Scalability**: Consume events from the bus instead of the Asterisk websocket. This will improve
  the performance of Wazo and allow greater scalability.
- **Documentation**: Publish documentation describing bus events used by the Wazo Platform

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the [changelog](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D22.11).

See you at the next sprint review!
