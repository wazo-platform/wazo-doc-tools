Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 21.01 release.

## New features in this release

- **Call recording**: Until Wazo Platform 21.01, call recording was either on or off, for all calls of a user. In 21.01, new options have been added to control which calls are automatically recorded: placed or received calls, as well as internal or external (i.e. through a trunk) phone calls.

- **Call recording**: There is now a new API to start or stop recording a call.

## Technical features

- **Asterisk**: Asterisk has been updated to 18.1.1. See the Asterisk release announcement for [18.0.0](https://www.asterisk.org/asterisk-news/asterisk-18-0-0-now-available/), and [18.1.1](https://www.asterisk.org/asterisk-news/asterisk-13-38-1-16-15-1-17-9-1-and-18-1-1-now-available-security/).

## Ongoing features

- **Call recording**: we are working to improve the Wazo Platform API to easily get call recordings.

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the roadmap linked below.

See you at the next sprint review!
