Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 20.09 release.

## New features in this release

- **WebSocket**: A new ping/pong command has been implemented in the Wazo WebSocket. This allows clients to detect more easily when the network connection with the server is interrupted.

## Technical features

- **Asterisk**: Asterisk process priority has been changed to realtime priority. This increases stability and voice quality when the server is under load.
- **Performance**: We have removed the use of encryption for internal HTTP communication between Wazo components. Encryption now only happens when Wazo is sending/receiving data from the outside world.

## Ongoing features

- **Directories**: We are adding a GraphQL API in wazo-dird to reduce the number of requests and improve performance.
- **SIP lines and trunks**: We are currently rewriting the SIP configuration API to match PJSIP options and be multi-tenant

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the roadmap linked below.

See you at the next sprint review!
