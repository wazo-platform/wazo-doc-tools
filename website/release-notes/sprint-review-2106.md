Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 21.06 release.

## New features in this release

- **Retention**: We added the possibility to automatically delete call recordings. Furthermore, it is now possible to configure the automatic deletion of CDRs and call recordings via REST API for each tenant. For instance, this makes it possible to abide by European GDPR regulations.

## Technical features

**Asterisk**: Asterisk has been upgraded to 18.3.0. See the [Asterisk release announcement](https://www.asterisk.org/asterisk-news/asterisk-18-3-0-now-available/)

## Ongoing features

- **Call recording**: We are working to improve the Wazo Platform API to easily retrieve multiple call recordings.

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the roadmap linked below.

See you at the next sprint review!
