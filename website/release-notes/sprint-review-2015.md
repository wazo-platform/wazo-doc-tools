Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 20.15 release.

## New features in this release

- **Contact Center Stats API**: The queue statistics have been improved and may now be aggregated by day or by month, to provide insights on a queue on long periods of time.
- **Contact Center Stats API**: The begin and end time of the statistics are now timezone aware.
- **External application API**: A new API has been added to configure external applications for users and tenants. This API can be used by an administrator to control how an external application will behave.

## Technical features

- **Asterisk**: Asterisk was upgraded to 17.8.1. This is a security release, so we strongly recommend you to update your Wazo Platform.

## Ongoing features

- **Contact Center Stats API**: We are working to expose all the statistics for queues and agents through REST API.
