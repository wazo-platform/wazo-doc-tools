Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 20.12 release.

## New features in this release

- **Conferences**: until Wazo Platform 20.12, the only way to create conferences was to ask users to dial a specific extension pointing to a conference room. It is now possible to merge two or more existing calls together to create what we call an adhoc conference.

- **CTI**: Wazo Platform offers an API to control physical phones. Until 20.12, Wazo Platform could mute, hangup or hold a call on a physical phone. There is now a new API to answer a physical phone call. This feature is currently only available for Yealink phones.

## Bug fixes

- **Outcalls**: if a user had set a custom music-on-hold on their account, the default system music-on-hold was being played anyway when the user placed an outcall on hold. Now it is the correct one that is used.

## Ongoing features

- **SIP lines and trunks**: We are currently rewriting the SIP configuration API to match PJSIP options and be multi-tenant.

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the changelog linked below.

See you at the next sprint review!
