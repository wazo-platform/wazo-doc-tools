Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 23.03 release.

## New Features in This Release

- **New user API**: The user creation endpoint has been revamped to be able to create all user's resources with one API call. See [documentation for more info](https://wazo-platform.org/uc-doc/api_sdk/rest_api/confd/user_management)

## Ongoing Features

- **New user API**: We are working on a new high level API endpoint to update a user and all of its related resources (user, line, extension, voicemail, incoming call) in a single HTTP request.
- **Major upgrade**: We are preparing the upgrade to Debian 11 Bullseye.
- **Scalability**: We are adding tools to be able to observe the state of a Wazo stack

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the [changelog](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D23.03).
