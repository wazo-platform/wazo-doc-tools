Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 21.09 release.

## New Features in This Release

- **Import**: A new tool is available to ease migration to Wazo. See
  [documentation](https://wazo-platform.org/uc-doc/administration/import_export)
- **Incall**: Music on Hold can now be played when an incall redirects to a user.
- **Phones**: A new phone provisioning plugin has been added to support Gigaset N870.
- **REST API**: To make REST APIs easier to use, authentication policies can now be identified by a
  slug instead of their UUID.

## Bug Fixes

- **Asterisk**: Fix Asterisk [STUN issue](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/browse/WAZO-2237) when IP
  of STUN server changes while Asterisk is running.

## Technical Features

- **Authorization**: Users cannot give permissions to other users if they don't already have those
  permissions themselves.
- **Asterisk**: Asterisk has been upgraded to 18.5.0. See the
  [Asterisk release announcement](https://www.asterisk.org/asterisk-news/asterisk-18-5-0-now-available/)

## Ongoing Features

- **Conference**: We are working on a better integration of conference actions, such as raising
  hand or mute/unmute, by adding events and REST APIs to control them.
- **Group**: Improve users and groups interactions, like avoiding ringing a user's phone when DND
  is enabled and better mobile push notifications integration.

See you at the next sprint review!
