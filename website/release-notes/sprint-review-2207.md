Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 22.07 release.

No major feature added this sprint, we are hard at work on the following features:

## Ongoing Features

- **Authentication**: Improve the LDAP authentication source by identifying tenants by domain name
- **Meetings**: Improve external conferences that allow guests to join a meeting
- **Bullseye**: Modernizing some old services to facilitate transition to Python 3 and Debian Bullseye
- **Scalability**: Consume events from the bus instead of the Asterisk websocket. This will improve the performance of Wazo and allow greater scalability.

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the [changelog](https://wazo-dev.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%3DWAZO%20AND%20fixVersion%3D22.07).

See you at the next sprint review!
