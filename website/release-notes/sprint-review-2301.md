Hello Wazo Platform community!

Happy New Year :)
Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 23.01 release.

## Community

- **Chat**:Â  We can now create a chat room with up to 100 participants (a.k.a
  group chat). Thanks to Mehdi Emrani and Milad Razban for the contribution

## Technical Features

- **Python 3**: Migrated mostly all remaining libraries/scripts to Python 3 and
  remove Python 2 compatibility
- **Event**: Mostly all services now publish directly on wazo-headers exchange

## Ongoing Features

- **New user API**: We are working on a new high level API endpoint to create a
  user and all of its related resources (user, line, extension, voicemail,
  incoming call) in a single HTTP request.
- **Major upgrade**: We are preparing the upgrade to Debian 11 Bullseye.

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the
