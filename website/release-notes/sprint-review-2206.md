## New Features in This Release

- **Meetings**: Added ability for the meeting owner to kick a participant

## Bug Fixes

- **Mobile**: Fixed blank notifications on Android phones after receiving a call

## Technical Features

- **Asterisk**: Asterisk has been upgraded to 18.11.1. See the [Asterisk release announcement](https://www.asterisk.org/asterisk-news/asterisk-18-11-1-now-available/)

## Ongoing Features

- **Meetings**: Improve external conferences that allow guests to join a meeting
