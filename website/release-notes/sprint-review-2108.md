Hello Wazo Platform community!

Here is a short review of the Wazo Platform 21.08 release.

## New Features in This Release

- **Presence**: Until Wazo Platform 21.08, the API for user presence changed its `line_state` to `talking` right after the user placed a call. In Wazo Platform 21.08, the user's `line_state` will have two different states: `progressing` when the called party is ringing, then `talking` if the called party answers the call.
- **Phones**: The Grandstream GXP1628, GS-HT801-HT802, GRP2614, GXV3350 are now supported by the latest Grandstream phone plugin in Wazo Platform.
- **Events**: All call-related events emitted by Wazo Platform now include a `timestamp` metadata.
- **Switchboard**: Wazo Platform 21.08 allows changing the music-on-hold for switchboard waiting and hold queues.

## Ongoing Features

- **Music on hold**: We are working on adding specific music on hold for Incoming calls on specific DID.
- **Recordings**: We are working on polishing the call recordings API.

For more details about the aforementioned topics, please see the roadmap linked below.

See you at the next sprint review!
