title: 'Push Notifications'
---

The wazo-platform can generate push notifications for mobile users, through the wazo-webhookd
component.

wazo-webhookd manages subscriptions to internal platform events, such that custom behavior can be
triggered in reaction to those events. This allows, for example, for components external to the
wazo-platform to be notified of those events, in effect allowing for asynchronous integrations with
other systems. See [wazo-webhookd documentation page](/uc-doc/system/wazo-webhookd.md) for more
details.

As well as supporting configuration of custom behavior through http subscriptions(created through
the REST API) and custom python plugins, wazo-webhookd also automatically creates and manages
special subscriptions for mobile users, in order to support push notifications for relevant
wazo-platform events, such as calls to mobile-enabled users, voicemails, missed calls, etc.

When a mobile user logs in, authentication events generated by that user login are handled by
wazo-webhookd, which in turn creates a subscription for that user. That subscription specifies the
internal events which are relevant for push notifications to mobile users. When those events are
emitted by the platform, the subscription triggers the "hook" code that generates the relevant push
notification, by interacting with the configured push notification servers.

### Configuring push notifications

For push notifications to be supported, one of the supported push notification service must be
configured.

### Push notification types

Here are the push notification types which are currently generated by the wazo platform.

- `incomingCall`: a user-facing push notification to notify that the user is currently receiving a
  call, which they have a chance to answer; the notification data includes call event data, such as
  caller id;
- `missedCall`: a user-facing push notification to notify that a call has been received and was not
  answered by the user(whether an automatic forward has occured or not);  
  the notification title indicates that there is a new missed call, and the notification body
  specifies the name and number of the caller;  
  the notification data includes call event data, such as caller id name and number;
- `voicemailReceived`: a user-facing push notification to notify that a voicemail has been left in
  the user's mailbox;  
   the notification title indicates that there is a new voicemail, and notification body includes the
  caller id of the voicemail author(caller);  
   the notification data includes the voicemail event data;
- `messageReceived`: a user-facing push notification which indicates to the user that a chat message
  has been sent to(and received by) them;  
  the notification title will be the alias of the sender, and the body will be the content of the
  message; the notification data includes message event data;
- `cancelIncomingCall`: a data-only push notification which tells the mobile app to ignore a
  previous `incomingCall` notification, and to cancel any action started as a result of that
  `incomingCall`;  
   the notification data includes call cancel event data;
